9308101v1,Dynamic Backtracking,M. L. Ginsberg,"Because of their occasional need to return to shallow points in a search tree, existing backtracking methods can sometimes erase meaningful progress toward solving a search problem. In this paper, we present a method by which backtrack points can be moved deeper in the search space, thereby avoiding this difficulty. The technique developed is a variant of dependency-directed backtracking that uses only polynomial space while still providing useful control information and retaining the completeness guarantees provided by earlier approaches.",AI,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9308101v1.pdf
9308102v1,A Market-Oriented Programming Environment and its Application to   Distributed Multicommodity Flow Problems,M. P. Wellman,"Market price systems constitute a well-understood class of mechanisms that under certain conditions provide effective decentralization of decision making with minimal communication overhead. In a market-oriented programming approach to distributed problem solving, we derive the activities and resource allocations for a set of computational agents by computing the competitive equilibrium of an artificial economy. WALRAS provides basic constructs for defining computational market structures, and protocols for deriving their corresponding price equilibria. In a particular realization of this approach for a form of multicommodity flow problem, we see that careful construction of the decision process according to economic principles can lead to efficient distributed resource allocation, and that the behavior of the system can be meaningfully analyzed in economic terms.",AI,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9308102v1.pdf
9309101v1,An Empirical Analysis of Search in GSAT,"I. P. Gent, T. Walsh","We describe an extensive study of search in GSAT, an approximation procedure for propositional satisfiability. GSAT performs greedy hill-climbing on the number of satisfied clauses in a truth assignment. Our experiments provide a more complete picture of GSAT's search than previous accounts. We describe in detail the two phases of search: rapid hill-climbing followed by a long plateau search. We demonstrate that when applied to randomly generated 3SAT problems, there is a very simple scaling with problem size for both the mean number of satisfied clauses and the mean branching rate. Our results allow us to make detailed numerical conjectures about the length of the hill-climbing phase, the average gradient of this phase, and to conjecture that both the average score and average branching rate decay exponentially during plateau search. We end by showing how these results can be used to direct future theoretical analysis. This work provides a case study of how computer experiments can be used to improve understanding of the theoretical properties of algorithms.",AI,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9309101v1.pdf
9311101v1,The Difficulties of Learning Logic Programs with Cut,"F. Bergadano, D. Gunetti, U. Trinchero","As real logic programmers normally use cut (!), an effective learning procedure for logic programs should be able to deal with it. Because the cut predicate has only a procedural meaning, clauses containing cut cannot be learned using an extensional evaluation method, as is done in most learning systems. On the other hand, searching a space of possible programs (instead of a space of independent clauses) is unfeasible. An alternative solution is to generate first a candidate base program which covers the positive examples, and then make it consistent by inserting cut where appropriate. The problem of learning programs with cut has not been investigated before and this seems to be a natural and reasonable approach. We generalize this scheme and investigate the difficulties that arise. Some of the major shortcomings are actually caused, in general, by the need for intensional evaluation. As a conclusion, the analysis of this paper suggests, on precise and technical grounds, that learning cut is difficult, and current induction techniques should probably be restricted to purely declarative logic languages.",AI,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9311101v1.pdf
9311102v1,Software Agents: Completing Patterns and Constructing User Interfaces,"J. C. Schlimmer, L. A. Hermens","To support the goal of allowing users to record and retrieve information, this paper describes an interactive note-taking system for pen-based computers with two distinctive features. First, it actively predicts what the user is going to write. Second, it automatically constructs a custom, button-box user interface on request. The system is an example of a learning-apprentice software- agent. A machine learning component characterizes the syntax and semantics of the user's information. A performance system uses this learned information to generate completion strings and construct a user interface. Description of Online Appendix: People like to record information. Doing this on paper is initially efficient, but lacks flexibility. Recording information on a computer is less efficient but more powerful. In our new note taking softwre, the user records information directly on a computer. Behind the interface, an agent acts for the user. To help, it provides defaults and constructs a custom user interface. The demonstration is a QuickTime movie of the note taking agent in action. The file is a binhexed self-extracting archive. Macintosh utilities for binhex are available from mac.archive.umich.edu. QuickTime is available from ftp.apple.com in the dts/mac/sys.soft/quicktime.",AI,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9311102v1.pdf
9312101v1,Decidable Reasoning in Terminological Knowledge Representation Systems,"M. Buchheit, F. M. Donini, A. Schaerf","Terminological knowledge representation systems (TKRSs) are tools for designing and using knowledge bases that make use of terminological languages (or concept languages). We analyze from a theoretical point of view a TKRS whose capabilities go beyond the ones of presently available TKRSs. The new features studied, often required in practical applications, can be summarized in three main points. First, we consider a highly expressive terminological language, called ALCNR, including general complements of concepts, number restrictions and role conjunction. Second, we allow to express inclusion statements between general concepts, and terminological cycles as a particular case. Third, we prove the decidability of a number of desirable TKRS-deduction services (like satisfiability, subsumption and instance checking) through a sound, complete and terminating calculus for reasoning in ALCNR-knowledge bases. Our calculus extends the general technique of constraint systems. As a byproduct of the proof, we get also the result that inclusion statements in ALCNR can be simulated by terminological cycles, if descriptive semantics is adopted.",AI,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9312101v1.pdf
9401101v1,Teleo-Reactive Programs for Agent Control,N. Nilsson,"A formalism is presented for computing and organizing actions for autonomous agents in dynamic environments. We introduce the notion of teleo-reactive (T-R) programs whose execution entails the construction of circuitry for the continuous computation of the parameters and conditions on which agent action is based. In addition to continuous feedback, T-R programs support parameter binding and recursion. A primary difference between T-R programs and many other circuit-based systems is that the circuitry of T-R programs is more compact; it is constructed at run time and thus does not have to anticipate all the contingencies that might arise over all possible runs. In addition, T-R programs are intuitive and easy to write and are written in a form that is compatible with automatic planning and learning methods. We briefly describe some experimental applications of T-R programs in the control of simulated and actual mobile robots.",AI,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9401101v1.pdf
9402101v1,Learning the Past Tense of English Verbs: The Symbolic Pattern   Associator vs. Connectionist Models,C. X. Ling,"Learning the past tense of English verbs - a seemingly minor aspect of language acquisition - has generated heated debates since 1986, and has become a landmark task for testing the adequacy of cognitive modeling. Several artificial neural networks (ANNs) have been implemented, and a challenge for better symbolic models has been posed. In this paper, we present a general-purpose Symbolic Pattern Associator (SPA) based upon the decision-tree learning algorithm ID3. We conduct extensive head-to-head comparisons on the generalization ability between ANN models and the SPA under different representations. We conclude that the SPA generalizes the past tense of unseen verbs better than ANN models by a wide margin, and we offer insights as to why this should be the case. We also discuss a new default strategy for decision-tree learning algorithms.",AI,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9402101v1.pdf
9402102v1,Substructure Discovery Using Minimum Description Length and Background   Knowledge,"D. J. Cook, L. B. Holder","The ability to identify interesting and repetitive substructures is an essential component to discovering knowledge in structural data. We describe a new version of our SUBDUE substructure discovery system based on the minimum description length principle. The SUBDUE system discovers substructures that compress the original data and represent structural concepts in the data. By replacing previously-discovered substructures in the data, multiple passes of SUBDUE produce a hierarchical description of the structural regularities in the data. SUBDUE uses a computationally-bounded inexact graph match that identifies similar, but not identical, instances of a substructure and finds an approximate measure of closeness of two substructures when under computational constraints. In addition to the minimum description length principle, other background knowledge can be used by SUBDUE to guide the search towards more appropriate substructures. Experiments in a variety of domains demonstrate SUBDUE's ability to find substructures capable of compressing the original data and to discover structural concepts important to the domain. Description of Online Appendix: This is a compressed tar file containing the SUBDUE discovery system, written in C. The program accepts as input databases represented in graph form, and will output discovered substructures with their corresponding value.",AI,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9402102v1.pdf
9402103v1,Bias-Driven Revision of Logical Domain Theories,"M. Koppel, R. Feldman, A. M. Segre","The theory revision problem is the problem of how best to go about revising a deficient domain theory using information contained in examples that expose inaccuracies. In this paper we present our approach to the theory revision problem for propositional domain theories. The approach described here, called PTR, uses probabilities associated with domain theory elements to numerically track the ``flow'' of proof through the theory. This allows us to measure the precise role of a clause or literal in allowing or preventing a (desired or undesired) derivation for a given example. This information is used to efficiently locate and repair flawed elements of the theory. PTR is proved to converge to a theory which correctly classifies all examples, and shown experimentally to be fast and accurate even for deep theories.",AI,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9402103v1.pdf
9403101v1,Exploring the Decision Forest: An Empirical Investigation of Occam's   Razor in Decision Tree Induction,"P. M. Murphy, M. J. Pazzani","We report on a series of experiments in which all decision trees consistent with the training data are constructed. These experiments were run to gain an understanding of the properties of the set of consistent decision trees and the factors that affect the accuracy of individual trees. In particular, we investigated the relationship between the size of a decision tree consistent with some training data and the accuracy of the tree on test data. The experiments were performed on a massively parallel Maspar computer. The results of the experiments on several artificial and two real world problems indicate that, for many of the problems investigated, smaller consistent decision trees are on average less accurate than the average accuracy of slightly larger trees.",AI,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9403101v1.pdf
9406101v1,A Semantics and Complete Algorithm for Subsumption in the CLASSIC   Description Logic,"A. Borgida, P. F. Patel-Schneider","This paper analyzes the correctness of the subsumption algorithm used in CLASSIC, a description logic-based knowledge representation system that is being used in practical applications. In order to deal efficiently with individuals in CLASSIC descriptions, the developers have had to use an algorithm that is incomplete with respect to the standard, model-theoretic semantics for description logics. We provide a variant semantics for descriptions with respect to which the current implementation is complete, and which can be independently motivated. The soundness and completeness of the polynomial-time subsumption algorithm is established using description graphs, which are an abstracted version of the implementation structures used in CLASSIC, and are of independent interest.",AI,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9406101v1.pdf
9406102v1,Applying GSAT to Non-Clausal Formulas,R. Sebastiani,"In this paper we describe how to modify GSAT so that it can be applied to non-clausal formulas. The idea is to use a particular ``score'' function which gives the number of clauses of the CNF conversion of a formula which are false under a given truth assignment. Its value is computed in linear time, without constructing the CNF conversion itself. The proposed methodology applies to most of the variants of GSAT proposed so far.",AI,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9406102v1.pdf
9408101v1,Random Worlds and Maximum Entropy,"A. J. Grove, J. Y. Halpern, D. Koller","Given a knowledge base KB containing first-order and statistical facts, we consider a principled method, called the random-worlds method, for computing a degree of belief that some formula Phi holds given KB. If we are reasoning about a world or system consisting of N individuals, then we can consider all possible worlds, or first-order models, with domain {1,...,N} that satisfy KB, and compute the fraction of them in which Phi is true. We define the degree of belief to be the asymptotic value of this fraction as N grows large. We show that when the vocabulary underlying Phi and KB uses constants and unary predicates only, we can naturally associate an entropy with each world. As N grows larger, there are many more worlds with higher entropy. Therefore, we can use a maximum-entropy computation to compute the degree of belief. This result is in a similar spirit to previous work in physics and artificial intelligence, but is far more general. Of equal interest to the result itself are the limitations on its scope. Most importantly, the restriction to unary predicates seems necessary. Although the random-worlds method makes sense in general, the connection to maximum entropy seems to disappear in the non-unary case. These observations suggest unexpected limitations to the applicability of maximum-entropy methods.",AI,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9408101v1.pdf
9408102v1,Pattern Matching and Discourse Processing in Information Extraction from   Japanese Text,"T. Kitani, Y. Eriguchi, M. Hara","Information extraction is the task of automatically picking up information of interest from an unconstrained text. Information of interest is usually extracted in two steps. First, sentence level processing locates relevant pieces of information scattered throughout the text; second, discourse processing merges coreferential information to generate the output. In the first step, pieces of information are locally identified without recognizing any relationships among them. A key word search or simple pattern search can achieve this purpose. The second step requires deeper knowledge in order to understand relationships among separately identified pieces of information. Previous information extraction systems focused on the first step, partly because they were not required to link up each piece of information with other pieces. To link the extracted pieces of information and map them onto a structured output format, complex discourse processing is essential. This paper reports on a Japanese information extraction system that merges information using a pattern matcher and discourse processor. Evaluation results show a high level of system performance which approaches human performance.",AI,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9408102v1.pdf
9408103v1,A System for Induction of Oblique Decision Trees,"S. K. Murthy, S. Kasif, S. Salzberg","This article describes a new system for induction of oblique decision trees. This system, OC1, combines deterministic hill-climbing with two forms of randomization to find a good oblique split (in the form of a hyperplane) at each node of a decision tree. Oblique decision tree methods are tuned especially for domains in which the attributes are numeric, although they can be adapted to symbolic or mixed symbolic/numeric attributes. We present extensive empirical studies, using both real and artificial data, that analyze OC1's ability to construct oblique trees that are smaller and more accurate than their axis-parallel counterparts. We also examine the benefits of randomization for the construction of oblique decision trees.",AI,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9408103v1.pdf
9409101v1,On Planning while Learning,"S. Safra, M. Tennenholtz","This paper introduces a framework for Planning while Learning where an agent is given a goal to achieve in an environment whose behavior is only partially known to the agent. We discuss the tractability of various plan-design processes. We show that for a large natural class of Planning while Learning systems, a plan can be presented and verified in a reasonable time. However, coming up algorithmically with a plan, even for simple classes of systems is apparently intractable. We emphasize the role of off-line plan-design processes, and show that, in most natural cases, the verification (projection) part can be carried out in an efficient algorithmic manner.",AI,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9409101v1.pdf
9412101v1,Wrap-Up: a Trainable Discourse Module for Information Extraction,"S. Soderland, Lehnert. W","The vast amounts of on-line text now available have led to renewed interest in information extraction (IE) systems that analyze unrestricted text, producing a structured representation of selected information from the text. This paper presents a novel approach that uses machine learning to acquire knowledge for some of the higher level IE processing. Wrap-Up is a trainable IE discourse component that makes intersentential inferences and identifies logical relations among information extracted from the text. Previous corpus-based approaches were limited to lower level processing such as part-of-speech tagging, lexical disambiguation, and dictionary construction. Wrap-Up is fully trainable, and not only automatically decides what classifiers are needed, but even derives the feature set for each classifier automatically. Performance equals that of a partially trainable discourse module requiring manual customization for each domain.",AI,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9412101v1.pdf
9412102v1,Operations for Learning with Graphical Models,W. L. Buntine,"This paper is a multidisciplinary review of empirical, statistical learning from a graphical model perspective. Well-known examples of graphical models include Bayesian networks, directed graphs representing a Markov chain, and undirected networks representing a Markov field. These graphical models are extended to model data analysis and empirical learning using the notation of plates. Graphical operations for simplifying and manipulating a problem are provided including decomposition, differentiation, and the manipulation of probability models from the exponential family. Two standard algorithm schemas for learning are reviewed in a graphical framework: Gibbs sampling and the expectation maximization algorithm. Using these operations and schemas, some popular algorithms can be synthesized from their graphical specification. This includes versions of linear regression, techniques for feed-forward networks, and learning Gaussian and discrete Bayesian networks from data. The paper concludes by sketching some implications for data analysis and summarizing how some popular algorithms fall within the framework presented. The main original contributions here are the decomposition techniques and the demonstration that graphical models provide a framework for understanding and developing complex learning algorithms.",AI,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9412102v1.pdf
9412103v1,Total-Order and Partial-Order Planning: A Comparative Analysis,"S. Minton, J. Bresina, M. Drummond","For many years, the intuitions underlying partial-order planning were largely taken for granted. Only in the past few years has there been renewed interest in the fundamental principles underlying this paradigm. In this paper, we present a rigorous comparative analysis of partial-order and total-order planning by focusing on two specific planners that can be directly compared. We show that there are some subtle assumptions that underly the wide-spread intuitions regarding the supposed efficiency of partial-order planning. For instance, the superiority of partial-order planning can depend critically upon the search strategy and the structure of the search space. Understanding the underlying assumptions is crucial for constructing efficient planners.",AI,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9412103v1.pdf
9501101v1,Solving Multiclass Learning Problems via Error-Correcting Output Codes,"T. G. Dietterich, G. Bakiri","Multiclass learning problems involve finding a definition for an unknown function f(x) whose range is a discrete set containing k &gt 2 values (i.e., k ``classes''). The definition is acquired by studying collections of training examples of the form [x_i, f (x_i)]. Existing approaches to multiclass learning problems include direct application of multiclass algorithms such as the decision-tree algorithms C4.5 and CART, application of binary concept learning algorithms to learn individual binary functions for each of the k classes, and application of binary concept learning algorithms with distributed output representations. This paper compares these three approaches to a new technique in which error-correcting codes are employed as a distributed output representation. We show that these output representations improve the generalization performance of both C4.5 and backpropagation on a wide range of multiclass learning tasks. We also demonstrate that this approach is robust with respect to changes in the size of the training sample, the assignment of distributed representations to particular classes, and the application of overfitting avoidance techniques such as decision-tree pruning. Finally, we show that---like the other methods---the error-correcting code technique can provide reliable class probability estimates. Taken together, these results demonstrate that error-correcting output codes provide a general-purpose method for improving the performance of inductive learning programs on multiclass problems.",AI,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9501101v1.pdf
9501102v1,A Domain-Independent Algorithm for Plan Adaptation,"S. Hanks, D. S. Weld","The paradigms of transformational planning, case-based planning, and plan debugging all involve a process known as plan adaptation - modifying or repairing an old plan so it solves a new problem. In this paper we provide a domain-independent algorithm for plan adaptation, demonstrate that it is sound, complete, and systematic, and compare it to other adaptation algorithms in the literature. Our approach is based on a view of planning as searching a graph of partial plans. Generative planning starts at the graph's root and moves from node to node using plan-refinement operators. In planning by adaptation, a library plan - an arbitrary node in the plan graph - is the starting point for the search, and the plan-adaptation algorithm can apply both the same refinement operators available to a generative planner and can also retract constraints and steps from the plan. Our algorithm's completeness ensures that the adaptation algorithm will eventually search the entire graph and its systematicity ensures that it will do so without redundantly searching any parts of the graph.",AI,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9501102v1.pdf
9501103v1,Truncating Temporal Differences: On the Efficient Implementation of   TD(lambda) for Reinforcement Learning,P. Cichosz,"Temporal difference (TD) methods constitute a class of methods for learning predictions in multi-step prediction problems, parameterized by a recency factor lambda. Currently the most important application of these methods is to temporal credit assignment in reinforcement learning. Well known reinforcement learning algorithms, such as AHC or Q-learning, may be viewed as instances of TD learning. This paper examines the issues of the efficient and general implementation of TD(lambda) for arbitrary lambda, for use with reinforcement learning algorithms optimizing the discounted sum of rewards. The traditional approach, based on eligibility traces, is argued to suffer from both inefficiency and lack of generality. The TTD (Truncated Temporal Differences) procedure is proposed as an alternative, that indeed only approximates TD(lambda), but requires very little computation per action and can be used with arbitrary function representation methods. The idea from which it is derived is fairly simple and not new, but probably unexplored so far. Encouraging experimental results are presented, suggesting that using lambda &gt 0 with the TTD procedure allows one to obtain a significant learning speedup at essentially the same cost as usual TD(0) learning.",AI,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9501103v1.pdf
9503102v1,Cost-Sensitive Classification: Empirical Evaluation of a Hybrid Genetic   Decision Tree Induction Algorithm,P. D. Turney,"This paper introduces ICET, a new algorithm for cost-sensitive classification. ICET uses a genetic algorithm to evolve a population of biases for a decision tree induction algorithm. The fitness function of the genetic algorithm is the average cost of classification when using the decision tree, including both the costs of tests (features, measurements) and the costs of classification errors. ICET is compared here with three other algorithms for cost-sensitive classification - EG2, CS-ID3, and IDX - and also with C4.5, which classifies without regard to cost. The five algorithms are evaluated empirically on five real-world medical datasets. Three sets of experiments are performed. The first set examines the baseline performance of the five algorithms on the five datasets and establishes that ICET performs significantly better than its competitors. The second set tests the robustness of ICET under a variety of conditions and shows that ICET maintains its advantage. The third set looks at ICET's search in bias space and discovers a way to improve the search.",AI,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9503102v1.pdf
9504101v1,Rerepresenting and Restructuring Domain Theories: A Constructive   Induction Approach,"S. K. Donoho, L. A. Rendell","Theory revision integrates inductive learning and background knowledge by combining training examples with a coarse domain theory to produce a more accurate theory. There are two challenges that theory revision and other theory-guided systems face. First, a representation language appropriate for the initial theory may be inappropriate for an improved theory. While the original representation may concisely express the initial theory, a more accurate theory forced to use that same representation may be bulky, cumbersome, and difficult to reach. Second, a theory structure suitable for a coarse domain theory may be insufficient for a fine-tuned theory. Systems that produce only small, local changes to a theory have limited value for accomplishing complex structural alterations that may be required. Consequently, advanced theory-guided learning systems require flexible representation and flexible structure. An analysis of various theory revision systems and theory-guided learning systems reveals specific strengths and weaknesses in terms of these two desired properties. Designed to capture the underlying qualities of each system, a new system uses theory-guided constructive induction. Experiments in three domains show improvement over previous theory-guided systems. This leads to a study of the behavior, limitations, and potential of theory-guided constructive induction.",AI,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9504101v1.pdf
9505101v1,Using Pivot Consistency to Decompose and Solve Functional CSPs,P. David,"Many studies have been carried out in order to increase the search efficiency of constraint satisfaction problems; among them, some make use of structural properties of the constraint network; others take into account semantic properties of the constraints, generally assuming that all the constraints possess the given property. In this paper, we propose a new decomposition method benefiting from both semantic properties of functional constraints (not bijective constraints) and structural properties of the network; furthermore, not all the constraints need to be functional. We show that under some conditions, the existence of solutions can be guaranteed. We first characterize a particular subset of the variables, which we name a root set. We then introduce pivot consistency, a new local consistency which is a weak form of path consistency and can be achieved in O(n^2d^2) complexity (instead of O(n^3d^3) for path consistency), and we present associated properties; in particular, we show that any consistent instantiation of the root set can be linearly extended to a solution, which leads to the presentation of the aforementioned new method for solving by decomposing functional CSPs.",AI,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9505101v1.pdf

We first define a precise framework in which to study adaptive load balancing, important features of which are its stochastic nature and the purely local information available to individual agents. Given this framework, we show illuminating results on the interplay between basic adaptive behavior parameters and their effect on system efficiency. We then investigate the properties of adaptive load balancing in heterogeneous populations, and address the issue of exploration vs. exploitation in that context. Finally, we show that naive use of communication may not improve, and might even harm system efficiency.",AI,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9505102v1.pdf
9505103v1,Provably Bounded-Optimal Agents,"S. J. Russell, D. Subramanian","Since its inception, artificial intelligence has relied upon a theoretical foundation centered around perfect rationality as the desired property of intelligent systems. We argue, as others have done, that this foundation is inadequate because it imposes fundamentally unsatisfiable requirements. As a result, there has arisen a wide gap between theory and practice in AI, hindering progress in the field. We propose instead a property called bounded optimality. Roughly speaking, an agent is bounded-optimal if its program is a solution to the constrained optimization problem presented by its architecture and the task environment. We show how to construct agents with this property for a simple class of machine architectures in a broad class of real-time environments. We illustrate these results using a simple model of an automated mail sorting facility. We also define a weaker property, asymptotic bounded optimality (ABO), that generalizes the notion of optimality in classical complexity theory. We then construct universal ABO programs, i.e., programs that are ABO no matter what real-time constraints are applied. Universal ABO programs can be used as building blocks for more complex systems. We conclude with a discussion of the prospects for bounded optimality as a theoretical basis for AI, and relate it to similar trends in philosophy, economics, and game theory.",AI,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9505103v1.pdf
9505104v1,Pac-Learning Recursive Logic Programs: Efficient Algorithms,W. W. Cohen,"We present algorithms that learn certain classes of function-free recursive logic programs in polynomial time from equivalence queries. In particular, we show that a single k-ary recursive constant-depth determinate clause is learnable. Two-clause programs consisting of one learnable recursive clause and one constant-depth determinate non-recursive clause are also learnable, if an additional ``basecase'' oracle is assumed. These results immediately imply the pac-learnability of these classes. Although these classes of learnable recursive programs are very constrained, it is shown in a companion paper that they are maximally general, in that generalizing either class in any natural way leads to a computationally difficult learning problem. Thus, taken together with its companion paper, this paper establishes a boundary of efficient learnability for recursive logic programs.",AI,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9505104v1.pdf
9505105v1,Pac-learning Recursive Logic Programs: Negative Results,W. W. Cohen,"In a companion paper it was shown that the class of constant-depth determinate k-ary recursive clauses is efficiently learnable. In this paper we present negative results showing that any natural generalization of this class is hard to learn in Valiant's model of pac-learnability. In particular, we show that the following program classes are cryptographically hard to learn: programs with an unbounded number of constant-depth linear recursive clauses; programs with one constant-depth determinate clause containing an unbounded number of recursive calls; and programs with one linear recursive clause of constant locality. These results immediately imply the non-learnability of any more general class of programs. We also show that learning a constant-depth determinate program with either two linear recursive clauses or one linear recursive clause and one non-recursive clause is as hard as learning boolean DNF. Together with positive results from the companion paper, these negative results establish a boundary of efficient learnability for recursive function-free clauses.",AI,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9505105v1.pdf
9506101v1,FLECS: Planning with a Flexible Commitment Strategy,"M. Veloso, P. Stone","There has been evidence that least-commitment planners can efficiently handle planning problems that involve difficult goal interactions. This evidence has led to the common belief that delayed-commitment is the ""best"" possible planning strategy. However, we recently found evidence that eager-commitment planners can handle a variety of planning problems more efficiently, in particular those with difficult operator choices. Resigned to the futility of trying to find a universally successful planning strategy, we devised a planner that can be used to study which domains and problems are best for which planning strategies. In this article we introduce this new planning algorithm, FLECS, which uses a FLExible Commitment Strategy with respect to plan-step orderings. It is able to use any strategy from delayed-commitment to eager-commitment. The combination of delayed and eager operator-ordering commitments allows FLECS to take advantage of the benefits of explicitly using a simulated execution state and reasoning about planning constraints. FLECS can vary its commitment strategy across different problems and domains, and also during the course of a single planning problem. FLECS represents a novel contribution to planning in that it explicitly provides the choice of which commitment strategy to use while planning. FLECS provides a framework to investigate the mapping from planning domains and problems to efficient planning strategies.",AI,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9506101v1.pdf

The method, called FOIDL, is based on FOIL (Quinlan, 1990) but employs intensional background knowledge and avoids the need for explicit negative examples. It is particularly useful for problems that involve rules with specific exceptions, such as learning the past-tense of English verbs, a task widely studied in the context of the symbolic/connectionist debate.

Wilke","ion is one of the most promising approaches to improve the performance of problem solvers. In several domains abstraction by dropping sentences of a domain description -- as used in most hierarchical planners -- has proven useful. In this paper we present examples which illustrate significant drawbacks of abstraction by dropping sentences. To overcome these drawbacks, we propose a more general view of abstraction involving the change of representation language. We have developed a new abstraction methodology and a related sound and complete learning algorithm that allows the complete change of representation language of planning cases from concrete to abstract. However, to achieve a powerful change of the representation language, the abstract language itself as well as rules which describe admissible ways of abstracting states must be provided in the domain model. This new abstraction approach is the core of Paris (Plan Abstraction and Refinement in an Integrated System), a system in which abstract planning cases are automatically learned from given concrete cases. An empirical study in the domain of process planning in mechanical engineering shows significant advantages of the proposed reasoning from abstract cases over classical hierarchical planning.",AI,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9507101v1.pdf
9508101v1,Using Qualitative Hypotheses to Identify Inaccurate Data,"Q. Zhao, T. Nishida","Identifying inaccurate data has long been regarded as a significant and difficult problem in AI. In this paper, we present a new method for identifying inaccurate data on the basis of qualitative correlations among related data. First, we introduce the definitions of related data and qualitative correlations among related data. Then we put forward a new concept called support coefficient function (SCF). SCF can be used to extract, represent, and calculate qualitative correlations among related data within a dataset. We propose an approach to determining dynamic shift intervals of inaccurate data, and an approach to calculating possibility of identifying inaccurate data, respectively. Both of the approaches are based on SCF. Finally we present an algorithm for identifying inaccurate data by using qualitative correlations among related data as confirmatory or disconfirmatory evidence. We have developed a practical system for interpreting infrared spectra by applying the method, and have fully tested the system against several hundred real spectra. The experimental results show that the method is significantly better than the conventional methods used in many similar systems.",AI,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9508101v1.pdf
9508102v1,An Integrated Framework for Learning and Reasoning,"C. G. Giraud-Carrier, T. R. Martinez","Learning and reasoning are both aspects of what is considered to be intelligence. Their studies within AI have been separated historically, learning being the topic of machine learning and neural networks, and reasoning falling under classical (or symbolic) AI. However, learning and reasoning are in many ways interdependent. This paper discusses the nature of some of these interdependencies and proposes a general framework called FLARE, that combines inductive learning using prior knowledge together with reasoning in a propositional setting. Several examples that test the framework are presented, including classical induction, many important reasoning protocols and two simple expert systems.",AI,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9508102v1.pdf
9510101v1,Diffusion of Context and Credit Information in Markovian Models,"Y. Bengio, P. Frasconi","This paper studies the problem of ergodicity of transition probability matrices in Markovian models, such as hidden Markov models (HMMs), and how it makes very difficult the task of learning to represent long-term context for sequential data. This phenomenon hurts the forward propagation of long-term context information, as well as learning a hidden state representation to represent long-term context, which depends on propagating credit information backwards in time. Using results from Markov chain theory, we show that this problem of diffusion of context and credit is reduced when the transition probabilities approach 0 or 1, i.e., the transition probability matrices are sparse and the model essentially deterministic. The results found in this paper apply to learning approaches based on continuous optimization, such as gradient descent and the Baum-Welch algorithm.",AI,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9510101v1.pdf
9510102v1,Improving Connectionist Energy Minimization,"G. Pinkas, R. Dechter","Symmetric networks designed for energy minimization such as Boltzman machines and Hopfield nets are frequently investigated for use in optimization, constraint satisfaction and approximation of NP-hard problems. Nevertheless, finding a global solution (i.e., a global minimum for the energy function) is not guaranteed and even a local solution may take an exponential number of steps. We propose an improvement to the standard local activation function used for such networks. The improved algorithm guarantees that a global minimum is found in linear time for tree-like subnetworks. The algorithm, called activate, is uniform and does not assume that the network is tree-like. It can identify tree-like subnetworks even in cyclic topologies (arbitrary networks) and avoid local minima along these trees. For acyclic networks, the algorithm is guaranteed to converge to a global minimum from any initial state of the system (self-stabilization) and remains correct under various types of schedulers. On the negative side, we show that in the presence of cycles, no uniform algorithm exists that guarantees optimality even under a sequential asynchronous scheduler. An asynchronous scheduler can activate only one unit at a time while a synchronous scheduler can activate any number of units in a single time step. In addition, no uniform algorithm exists to optimize even acyclic networks when the scheduler is synchronous. Finally, we show how the algorithm can be improved using the cycle-cutset scheme. The general algorithm, called activate-with-cutset, improves over activate and has some performance guarantees that are related to the size of the network's cycle-cutset.",AI,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9510102v1.pdf
9510103v1,Learning Membership Functions in a Function-Based Object Recognition   System,"K. Woods, D. Cook, L. Hall, K. Bowyer, L. Stark","Functionality-based recognition systems recognize objects at the category level by reasoning about how well the objects support the expected function. Such systems naturally associate a ``measure of goodness'' or ``membership value'' with a recognized object. This measure of goodness is the result of combining individual measures, or membership values, from potentially many primitive evaluations of different properties of the object's shape. A membership function is used to compute the membership value when evaluating a primitive of a particular physical property of an object. In previous versions of a recognition system known as Gruff, the membership function for each of the primitive evaluations was hand-crafted by the system designer. In this paper, we provide a learning component for the Gruff system, called Omlet, that automatically learns membership functions given a set of example objects labeled with their desired category measure. The learning algorithm is generally applicable to any problem in which low-level membership values are combined through an and-or tree structure to give a final overall membership value.",AI,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9510103v1.pdf
9511101v1,Flexibly Instructable Agents,"S. B. Huffman, J. E. Laird","This paper presents an approach to learning from situated, interactive tutorial instruction within an ongoing agent. Tutorial instruction is a flexible (and thus powerful) paradigm for teaching tasks because it allows an instructor to communicate whatever types of knowledge an agent might need in whatever situations might arise. To support this flexibility, however, the agent must be able to learn multiple kinds of knowledge from a broad range of instructional interactions. Our approach, called situated explanation, achieves such learning through a combination of analytic and inductive techniques. It combines a form of explanation-based learning that is situated for each instruction with a full suite of contextually guided responses to incomplete explanations. The approach is implemented in an agent called Instructo-Soar that learns hierarchies of new tasks and other domain knowledge from interactive natural language instructions. Instructo-Soar meets three key requirements of flexible instructability that distinguish it from previous systems: (1) it can take known or unknown commands at any instruction point; (2) it can handle instructions that apply to either its current situation or to a hypothetical situation specified in language (as in, for instance, conditional instructions); and (3) it can learn, from instructions, each class of knowledge it uses to perform tasks.",AI,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9511101v1.pdf

The hardware platform, a special-purpose massively parallel system, has been chosen to minimize system production and operational costs. This paper presents a novel approach to expectation-driven low-level image segmentation, which can be mapped naturally onto mesh-connected massively parallel SIMD architectures capable of handling hierarchical data structures. The input image is assumed to contain a distorted version of a given template; a multiresolution stretching process is used to reshape the original template in accordance with the acquired image content, minimizing a potential function. The distorted template is the process output.",AI,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9512102v1.pdf
9512103v1,Generalization of Clauses under Implication,P. Idestam-Almquist,"In the area of inductive learning, generalization is a main operation, and the usual definition of induction is based on logical implication. Recently there has been a rising interest in clausal representation of knowledge in machine learning. Almost all inductive learning systems that perform generalization of clauses use the relation theta-subsumption instead of implication. The main reason is that there is a well-known and simple technique to compute least general generalizations under theta-subsumption, but not under implication. However generalization under theta-subsumption is inappropriate for learning recursive clauses, which is a crucial problem since recursion is the basic program structure of logic programs. We note that implication between clauses is undecidable, and we therefore introduce a stronger form of implication, called T-implication, which is decidable between clauses. We show that for every finite set of clauses there exists a least general generalization under T-implication. We describe a technique to reduce generalizations under implication of a clause to generalizations under theta-subsumption of what we call an expansion of the original clause. Moreover we show that for every non-tautological clause there exists a T-complete expansion, which means that every generalization under T-implication of the clause is reduced to a generalization under theta-subsumption of the expansion.",AI,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9512103v1.pdf

Our definition departs from the traditional view of causation in that causal assertions may vary with the set of decisions available. We argue that this approach provides added clarity to the notion of cause. Also in this paper, we examine the encoding of causal relationships in directed acyclic graphs. We describe a special class of influence diagrams, those in canonical form, and show its relationship to Pearl's representation of cause and effect. Finally, we show how canonical form facilitates counterfactual reasoning.",AI,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9512104v1.pdf
9512105v1,Translating between Horn Representations and their Characteristic Models,R. Khardon,"Characteristic models are an alternative, model based, representation for Horn expressions. It has been shown that these two representations are incomparable and each has its advantages over the other. It is therefore natural to ask what is the cost of translating, back and forth, between these representations. Interestingly, the same translation questions arise in database theory, where it has applications to the design of relational databases. This paper studies the computational complexity of these problems. Our main result is that the two translation problems are equivalent under polynomial reductions, and that they are equivalent to the corresponding decision problem. Namely, translating is equivalent to deciding whether a given set of models is the set of characteristic models for a given Horn expression. We also relate these problems to the hypergraph transversal problem, a well known problem which is related to other applications in AI and for which no polynomial time algorithm is known. It is shown that in general our translation problems are at least as hard as the hypergraph transversal problem, and in a special case they are equivalent to it.",AI,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9512105v1.pdf

Thereafter, the playing strengths are compared by means of tournaments between the resulting versions of a world-class Othello program.

A central objective of the method and representation is the induction of compact, easily interpretable solutions. This rule-based decision model can be extended to search efficiently for similar cases prior to approximating function values. Experimental results on real-world data demonstrate that the new techniques are competitive with existing machine learning and statistical methods and can sometimes yield superior regression performance.",AI,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9512107v1.pdf
9601101v1,The Design and Experimental Analysis of Algorithms for Temporal   Reasoning,"P. vanBeek, D. W.

In this paper, we discuss the design and empirical analysis of algorithms for a temporal reasoning system based on Allen's influential interval-based framework for representing temporal information. At the core of the system are algorithms for determining whether the temporal information is consistent, and, if so, finding one or more scenarios that are consistent with the temporal information. Two important algorithms for these tasks are a path consistency algorithm and a backtracking algorithm. For the path consistency algorithm, we develop techniques that can result in up to a ten-fold speedup over an already highly optimized implementation. For the backtracking algorithm, we develop variable and value ordering heuristics that are shown empirically to dramatically improve the performance of the algorithm. As well, we show that a previously suggested reformulation of the backtracking search problem can reduce the time and space requirements of the backtracking search. Taken together, the techniques we develop allow a temporal reasoning component to solve problems that are of practical size.",AI,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9601101v1.pdf

In this extension information about preferences between rules can be expressed in the logical language and derived dynamically. This is achieved by using a reserved predicate symbol and a naming technique. Conflicts among rules are resolved whenever possible on the basis of derived preference information. The well-founded conclusions of prioritized logic programs can be computed in polynomial time.

Our goal in this paper is to take a first step toward dynamic reasoning in probabilistic databases with comparable efficiency. We propose a dynamic data structure that supports efficient algorithms for updating and querying singly connected Bayesian networks. In the conventional algorithm, new evidence is absorbed in O(1) time and queries are processed in time O(N), where N is the size of the network. We propose an algorithm which, after a preprocessing phase, allows us to answer queries in time O(log N) at the expense of O(log N) time per evidence absorption. The usefulness of sub-linear processing time manifests itself in applications requiring (near) real-time response over large probabilistic databases. We briefly discuss a potential application of dynamic probabilistic reasoning in computational biology.",AI,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9602102v1.pdf

This is done by exploiting the same aspects of problem structure as used by classical backtrack methods to avoid unproductive search choices. This quantum algorithm is much more likely to find solutions than the simple direct use of quantum parallelism. Furthermore, empirical evaluation on small problems shows this quantum algorithm displays the same phase transition behavior, and at the same location, as seen in many previously studied classical search methods. Specifically, difficult problem instances are concentrated near the abrupt change from underconstrained to overconstrained problems.",AI,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9603101v1.pdf

We then show how the same principles may be used to select data for two alternative, statistically-based learning architectures: mixtures of Gaussians and locally weighted regression. While the techniques for neural networks are computationally expensive and approximate, the techniques for mixtures of Gaussians and locally weighted regression are both efficient and accurate. Empirically, we observe that the optimality criterion sharply decreases the number of training examples the learner needs in order to achieve good performance.",AI,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9603104v1.pdf

9604102v1,Practical Methods for Proving Termination of General Logic Programs,E. Marchiori,"Termination of logic programs with negated body atoms (here called general logic programs) is an important topic. One reason is that many computational mechanisms used to process negated atoms, like Clark's negation as failure and Chan's constructive negation, are based on termination conditions. This paper introduces a methodology for proving termination of general logic programs w.r.t. the Prolog selection rule. The idea is to distinguish parts of the program depending on whether or not their termination depends on the selection rule. To this end, the notions of low-, weakly up-, and up-acceptable program are introduced. We use these notions to develop a methodology for proving termination of general logic programs, and show how interesting problems in non-monotonic reasoning can be formalized and implemented by means of terminating general logic programs.",AI,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9604102v1.pdf
9604103v1,Iterative Optimization and Simplification of Hierarchical Clusterings,D. Fisher,"Clustering is often used for discovering structure in data. Clustering systems differ in the objective function used to evaluate clustering quality and the control strategy used to search the space of clusterings. Ideally, the search strategy should consistently construct clusterings of high quality, but be computationally inexpensive as well. In general, we cannot have it both ways, but we can partition the search so that a system inexpensively constructs a `tentative' clustering for initial examination, followed by iterative optimization, which continues to search in background for improved clusterings. Given this motivation, we evaluate an inexpensive strategy for creating initial clusterings, coupled with several control strategies for iterative optimization, each of which repeatedly modifies an initial clustering in search of a better one. One of these methods appears novel as an iterative optimization strategy in clustering contexts. Once a clustering has been constructed it is judged by analysts -- often according to task-specific criteria. Several authors have abstracted these criteria and posited a generic performance task akin to pattern completion, where the error rate over completed patterns is used to `externally' judge clustering utility. Given this performance task, we adapt resampling-based pruning strategies used by supervised learning systems to the task of simplifying hierarchical clusterings, thus promising to ease post-clustering analysis. Finally, we propose a number of objective functions, based on attribute-selection measures for decision-tree induction, that might perform well on the error rate and simplicity dimensions.",AI,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9604103v1.pdf

A~systematic procedure is presented for post-processing decision trees produced by C4.5. This procedure was derived by rejecting Occam's razor and instead attending to the assumption that similar objects are likely to belong to the same class. It increases a decision tree's complexity without altering the performance of that tree on the training data from which it is inferred. The resulting more complex decision trees are demonstrated to have, on average, for a variety of common learning tasks, higher predictive accuracy than the less complex original decision trees. This result raises considerable doubt about the utility of Occam's razor as it is commonly applied in modern machine learning.",AI,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9605101v1.pdf

In ILP, the three most important generality orders are subsumption, implication and implication relative to background knowledge. The two languages used most often are languages of clauses and languages of only Horn clauses. This gives a total of six different ordered languages. In this paper, we give a systematic treatment of the existence or non-existence of least generalizations and greatest specializations of finite sets of clauses in each of these six ordered sets. We survey results already obtained by others and also contribute some answers of our own. Our main new results are, firstly, the existence of a computable least generalization under implication of every finite set of clauses containing at least one non-tautologous function-free clause (among other, not necessarily function-free clauses). Secondly, we show that such a least generalization need not exist under relative implication, not even if both the set that is to be generalized and the background knowledge are function-free.

Our proofs are constructive in that they are accompanied with learning algorithms. Our framework captures both empirical and explanation-based speedup learning in a unified fashion.

9605106v1,2Planning for Contingencies: A Decision-based Approach,"L. Pryor, G. Collins","A fundamental assumption made by classical AI planners is that there is no uncertainty in the world: the planner has full knowledge of the conditions under which the plan will be executed and the outcome of every action is fully predictable. These planners cannot therefore construct contingency plans, i.e., plans in which different actions are performed in different circumstances. In this paper we discuss some issues that arise in the representation and construction of contingency plans and describe Cassandra, a partial-order contingency planner. Cassandra uses explicit decision-steps that enable the agent executing the plan to decide which plan branch to follow. The decision-steps in a plan result in subgoals to acquire knowledge, which are planned for in the same way as any other subgoals. Cassandra thus distinguishes the process of gathering information from the process of making decisions. The explicit representation of decisions in Cassandra allows a coherent approach to the problems of contingent planning, and provides a solid base for extensions such as the use of different decision-making procedures.",AI,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9605106v1.pdf

Recently, it has been suggested that this problem can be solved efficiently by symbolically reasoning about geometry. This approach, called degrees of freedom analysis, employs a set of specialized routines called plan fragments that specify how to change the configuration of a set of bodies to satisfy a new constraint while preserving existing constraints. A potential drawback, which limits the scalability of this approach, is concerned with the difficulty of writing plan fragments.

We refer to such systems as partially controlled multi-agent systems, and we investigate how one might influence the behavior of the uncontrolled agents through appropriate design of the controlled agents. In particular, we wish to understand which problems are naturally described in these terms, what methods can be applied to influence the uncontrollable agents, the effectiveness of such methods, and whether similar methods work across different domains. Using a game-theoretic framework, this paper studies the design of partially controlled multi-agent systems in two contexts: in one context, the uncontrollable agents are expected utility maximizers, while in the other they are reinforcement learners.

9608103v1,Spatial Aggregation: Theory and Applications,"K. Yip, F. Zhao","Visual thinking plays an important role in scientific reasoning. Based on the research in automating diverse reasoning tasks about dynamical systems, nonlinear controllers, kinematic mechanisms, and fluid motion, we have identified a style of visual thinking, imagistic reasoning. Imagistic reasoning organizes computations around image-like, analogue representations so that perceptual and symbolic operations can be brought to bear to infer structure and behavior. Programs incorporating imagistic reasoning have been shown to perform at an expert level in domains that defy current analytic or numerical methods. We have developed a computational paradigm, spatial aggregation, to unify the description of a class of imagistic problem solvers. A program written in this paradigm has the following properties. It takes a continuous field and optional objective functions as input, and produces high-level descriptions of structure, behavior, or control actions. It computes a multi-layer of intermediate representations, called spatial aggregates, by forming equivalence classes and adjacency relations. It employs a small set of generic operators such as aggregation, classification, and localization to perform bidirectional mapping between the information-rich field and successively more abstract spatial aggregates. It uses a data structure, the neighborhood graph, as a common interface to modularize computations. To illustrate our theory, we describe the computational structure of three implemented problem solvers -- KAM, MAPS, and HIPAIR --- in terms of the spatial aggregation generic operators by mixing and matching a library of commonly used routines.",AI,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9608103v1.pdf

In this paper we present a hierarchy of classes of knowledge bases, Omega_1,Omega_2,..., with the following properties: first, Omega_1 is the class of all stratified knowledge bases; second, if a knowledge base Pi is in Omega_k, then Pi has at most k stable models, and all of them may be found in time O(lnk), where l is the length of the knowledge base and n the number of atoms in Pi; third, for an arbitrary knowledge base Pi, we can find the minimum k such that Pi belongs to Omega_k in time polynomial in the size of Pi; and, last, where K is the class of all knowledge bases, it is the case that union{i=1 to infty} Omega_i = K, that is, every knowledge base belongs to some class in the hierarchy.",AI,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9608104v1.pdf
9609101v1,Accelerating Partial-Order Planners: Some Techniques for Effective   Search Control and Pruning,"A. Gerevini, L. Schubert","We propose some domain-independent techniques for bringing well-founded partial-order planners closer to practicality. The first two techniques are aimed at improving search control while keeping overhead costs low. One is based on a simple adjustment to the default A* heuristic used by UCPOP to select plans for refinement. The other is based on preferring ``zero commitment'' (forced) plan refinements whenever possible, and using LIFO prioritization otherwise. A more radical technique is the use of operator parameter domains to prune search. These domains are initially computed from the definitions of the operators and the initial and goal conditions, using a polynomial-time algorithm that propagates sets of constants through the operator graph, starting in the initial conditions. During planning, parameter domains can be used to prune nonviable operator instances and to remove spurious clobbering threats. In experiments based on modifications of UCPOP, our improved plan and goal selection strategies gave speedups by factors ranging from 5 to more than 1000 for a variety of problems that are nontrivial for the unmodified version. Crucially, the hardest problems gave the greatest improvements. The pruning technique based on parameter domains often gave speedups by an order of magnitude or more for difficult problems, both with the default UCPOP search strategy and with our improved strategy. The Lisp code for our techniques and for the test problems is provided in on-line appendices.",AI,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9609101v1.pdf
9609102v1,Cue Phrase Classification Using Machine Learning,D. J. Litman,"Cue phrases may be used in a discourse sense to explicitly signal discourse structure, but also in a sentential sense to convey semantic rather than structural information. Correctly classifying cue phrases as discourse or sentential is critical in natural language processing systems that exploit discourse structure, e.g., for performing tasks such as anaphora resolution and plan recognition. This paper explores the use of machine learning for classifying cue phrases as discourse or sentential. Two machine learning programs (Cgrendel and C4.5) are used to induce classification models from sets of pre-classified cue phrases and their features in text and speech. Machine learning is shown to be an effective technique for not only automating the generation of classification models, but also for improving upon previous results. When compared to manually derived classification models already in the literature, the learned models often perform with higher accuracy and contain new linguistic insights into the data. In addition, the ability to automatically construct classification models makes it easier to comparatively analyze the utility of alternative feature representations of the data. Finally, the ease of retraining makes the learning approach more scalable and flexible than manual methods.",AI,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9609102v1.pdf
9610101v1,Mechanisms for Automated Negotiation in State Oriented Domains,"G. Zlotkin, J. S. Rosenschein","This paper lays part of the groundwork for a domain theory of negotiation, that is, a way of classifying interactions so that it is clear, given a domain, which negotiation mechanisms and strategies are appropriate. We define State Oriented Domains, a general category of interaction. Necessary and sufficient conditions for cooperation are outlined. We use the notion of worth in an altered definition of utility, thus enabling agreements in a wider class of joint-goal reachable situations. An approach is offered for conflict resolution, and it is shown that even in a conflict situation, partial cooperative steps can be taken by interacting agents (that is, agents in fundamental conflict might still agree to cooperate up to a certain point). A Unified Negotiation Protocol (UNP) is developed that can be used in all types of encounters. It is shown that in certain borderline cooperative situations, a partial cooperative agreement (i.e., one that does not achieve all agents' goals) might be preferred by all agents, even though there exists a rational agreement that would achieve all their goals. Finally, we analyze cases where agents have incomplete information on the goals and worth of other agents. First we consider the case where agents' goals are private information, and we analyze what goal declaration strategies the agents might adopt to increase their utility. Then, we consider the situation where the agents' goals (and therefore stand-alone costs) are common knowledge, but the worth they attach to their goals is private information. We introduce two mechanisms, one 'strict', the other 'tolerant', and analyze their affects on the stability and efficiency of negotiation outcomes.",AI,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9610101v1.pdf

Quinlan,"First-order learning involves finding a clause-form definition of a relation from examples of the relation and relevant background information. In this paper, a particular first-order learning system is modified to customize it for finding definitions of functional relations. This restriction leads to faster learning times and, in some cases, to definitions that have higher predictive accuracy. Other first-order learning systems might benefit from similar specialization.",AI,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9610102v1.pdf
9611101v1,MUSE CSP: An Extension to the Constraint Satisfaction Problem,"R. A Helzerman, M. P. Harper","This paper describes an extension to the constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) called MUSE CSP (MUltiply SEgmented Constraint Satisfaction Problem). This extension is especially useful for those problems which segment into multiple sets of partially shared variables. Such problems arise naturally in signal processing applications including computer vision, speech processing, and handwriting recognition. For these applications, it is often difficult to segment the data in only one way given the low-level information utilized by the segmentation algorithms. MUSE CSP can be used to compactly represent several similar instances of the constraint satisfaction problem. If multiple instances of a CSP have some common variables which have the same domains and constraints, then they can be combined into a single instance of a MUSE CSP, reducing the work required to apply the constraints. We introduce the concepts of MUSE node consistency, MUSE arc consistency, and MUSE path consistency. We then demonstrate how MUSE CSP can be used to compactly represent lexically ambiguous sentences and the multiple sentence hypotheses that are often generated by speech recognition algorithms so that grammar constraints can be used to provide parses for all syntactically correct sentences. Algorithms for MUSE arc and path consistency are provided. Finally, we discuss how to create a MUSE CSP from a set of CSPs which are labeled to indicate when the same variable is shared by more than a single CSP.",AI,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9611101v1.pdf
9612101v1,Exploiting Causal Independence in Bayesian Network Inference,"N. L. Zhang, D. Poole","A new method is proposed for exploiting causal independencies in exact Bayesian network inference. A Bayesian network can be viewed as representing a factorization of a joint probability into the multiplication of a set of conditional probabilities. We present a notion of causal independence that enables one to further factorize the conditional probabilities into a combination of even smaller factors and consequently obtain a finer-grain factorization of the joint probability. The new formulation of causal independence lets us specify the conditional probability of a variable given its parents in terms of an associative and commutative operator, such as ``or'', ``sum'' or ``max'', on the contribution of each parent. We start with a simple algorithm VE for Bayesian network inference that, given evidence and a query variable, uses the factorization to find the posterior distribution of the query. We show how this algorithm can be extended to exploit causal independence. Empirical studies, based on the CPCS networks for medical diagnosis, show that this method is more efficient than previous methods and allows for inference in larger networks than previous algorithms.",AI,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9612101v1.pdf

This paper describes three intelligent user interfaces: handwriting recognition, adaptive menus, and predictive fillin. In the context of adding a personUs name and address to an electronic organizer, tests show handwriting recognition is slower than typing on an on-screen, soft keyboard, while adaptive menus and predictive fillin can be twice as fast.

Martinez","Instance-based learning techniques typically handle continuous and linear input values well, but often do not handle nominal input attributes appropriately. The Value Difference Metric (VDM) was designed to find reasonable distance values between nominal attribute values, but it largely ignores continuous attributes, requiring discretization to map continuous values into nominal values. This paper proposes three new heterogeneous distance functions, called the Heterogeneous Value Difference Metric (HVDM), the Interpolated Value Difference Metric (IVDM), and the Windowed Value Difference Metric (WVDM). These new distance functions are designed to handle applications with nominal attributes, continuous attributes, or both. In experiments on 48 applications the new distance metrics achieve higher classification accuracy on average than three previous distance functions on those datasets that have both nominal and continuous attributes.",AI,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9701101v1.pdf
9701102v1,SCREEN: Learning a Flat Syntactic and Semantic Spoken Language Analysis   Using Artificial Neural Networks,"S. Wermter, V. Weber","Previous approaches of analyzing spontaneously spoken language often have been based on encoding syntactic and semantic knowledge manually and symbolically. While there has been some progress using statistical or connectionist language models, many current spoken- language systems still use a relatively brittle, hand-coded symbolic grammar or symbolic semantic component. In contrast, we describe a so-called screening approach for learning robust processing of spontaneously spoken language. A screening approach is a flat analysis which uses shallow sequences of category representations for analyzing an utterance at various syntactic, semantic and dialog levels. Rather than using a deeply structured symbolic analysis, we use a flat connectionist analysis. This screening approach aims at supporting speech and language processing by using (1) data-driven learning and (2) robustness of connectionist networks. In order to test this approach, we have developed the SCREEN system which is based on this new robust, learned and flat analysis. In this paper, we focus on a detailed description of SCREEN's architecture, the flat syntactic and semantic analysis, the interaction with a speech recognizer, and a detailed evaluation analysis of the robustness under the influence of noisy or incomplete input. The main result of this paper is that flat representations allow more robust processing of spontaneous spoken language than deeply structured representations. In particular, we show how the fault-tolerance and learning capability of connectionist networks can support a flat analysis for providing more robust spoken-language processing within an overall hybrid symbolic/connectionist framework.",AI,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9701102v1.pdf
9703101v1,A Uniform Framework for Concept Definitions in Description Logics,"G. DeGiacomo, M. Lenzerini","Most modern formalisms used in Databases and Artificial Intelligence for describing an application domain are based on the notions of class (or concept) and relationship among classes. One interesting feature of such formalisms is the possibility of defining a class, i.e., providing a set of properties that precisely characterize the instances of the class. Many recent articles point out that there are several ways of assigning a meaning to a class definition containing some sort of recursion. In this paper, we argue that, instead of choosing a single style of semantics, we achieve better results by adopting a formalism that allows for different semantics to coexist. We demonstrate the feasibility of our argument, by presenting a knowledge representation formalism, the description logic muALCQ, with the above characteristics. In addition to the constructs for conjunction, disjunction, negation, quantifiers, and qualified number restrictions, muALCQ includes special fixpoint constructs to express (suitably interpreted) recursive definitions. These constructs enable the usual frame-based descriptions to be combined with definitions of recursive data structures such as directed acyclic graphs, lists, streams, etc. We establish several properties of muALCQ, including the decidability and the computational complexity of reasoning, by formulating a correspondence with a particular modal logic of programs called the modal mu-calculus.",AI,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9703101v1.pdf

We refer to this thicker notion of environment as a lifeworld and present a partial set of formal tools for describing structures of lifeworlds and the ways in which they computationally simplify activity. As one specific example, we apply the tools to the analysis of the Toast system and show how versions of the system with very different control structures in fact implement a common control structure together with different conventions for encoding task state in the positions or states of objects in the environment.",AI,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9704101v1.pdf
9705101v1,Query DAGs: A Practical Paradigm for Implementing Belief-Network   Inference,"A. Darwiche, G. Provan","We describe a new paradigm for implementing inference in belief networks, which consists of two steps: (1) compiling a belief network into an arithmetic expression called a Query DAG (Q-DAG); and (2) answering queries using a simple evaluation algorithm. Each node of a Q-DAG represents a numeric operation, a number, or a symbol for evidence. Each leaf node of a Q-DAG represents the answer to a network query, that is, the probability of some event of interest. It appears that Q-DAGs can be generated using any of the standard algorithms for exact inference in belief networks (we show how they can be generated using clustering and conditioning algorithms). The time and space complexity of a Q-DAG generation algorithm is no worse than the time complexity of the inference algorithm on which it is based. The complexity of a Q-DAG evaluation algorithm is linear in the size of the Q-DAG, and such inference amounts to a standard evaluation of the arithmetic expression it represents. The intended value of Q-DAGs is in reducing the software and hardware resources required to utilize belief networks in on-line, real-world applications. The proposed framework also facilitates the development of on-line inference on different software and hardware platforms due to the simplicity of the Q-DAG evaluation algorithm. Interestingly enough, Q-DAGs were found to serve other purposes: simple techniques for reducing Q-DAGs tend to subsume relatively complex optimization techniques for belief-network inference, such as network-pruning and computation-caching.",AI,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9705101v1.pdf
9705102v1,Connectionist Theory Refinement: Genetically Searching the Space of   Network Topologies,"D. W. Opitz, J. W. Shavlik","An algorithm that learns from a set of examples should ideally be able to exploit the available resources of (a) abundant computing power and (b) domain-specific knowledge to improve its ability to generalize. Connectionist theory-refinement systems, which use background knowledge to select a neural network's topology and initial weights, have proven to be effective at exploiting domain-specific knowledge; however, most do not exploit available computing power. This weakness occurs because they lack the ability to refine the topology of the neural networks they produce, thereby limiting generalization, especially when given impoverished domain theories. We present the REGENT algorithm which uses (a) domain-specific knowledge to help create an initial population of knowledge-based neural networks and (b) genetic operators of crossover and mutation (specifically designed for knowledge-based networks) to continually search for better network topologies. Experiments on three real-world domains indicate that our new algorithm is able to significantly increase generalization compared to a standard connectionist theory-refinement system, as well as our previous algorithm for growing knowledge-based networks.",AI,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9705102v1.pdf
9706101v1,Flaw Selection Strategies for Partial-Order Planning,"M. E. Pollack, D. Joslin, M. Paolucci","Several recent studies have compared the relative efficiency of alternative flaw selection strategies for partial-order causal link (POCL) planning. We review this literature, and present new experimental results that generalize the earlier work and explain some of the discrepancies in it. In particular, we describe the Least-Cost Flaw Repair (LCFR) strategy developed and analyzed by Joslin and Pollack (1994), and compare it with other strategies, including Gerevini and Schubert's (1996) ZLIFO strategy. LCFR and ZLIFO make very different, and apparently conflicting claims about the most effective way to reduce search-space size in POCL planning. We resolve this conflict, arguing that much of the benefit that Gerevini and Schubert ascribe to the LIFO component of their ZLIFO strategy is better attributed to other causes. We show that for many problems, a strategy that combines least-cost flaw selection with the delay of separable threats will be effective in reducing search-space size, and will do so without excessive computational overhead. Although such a strategy thus provides a good default, we also show that certain domain characteristics may reduce its effectiveness.",AI,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9706101v1.pdf

Hogg","The easy-hard-easy pattern in the difficulty of combinatorial search problems as constraints are added has been explained as due to a competition between the decrease in number of solutions and increased pruning. We test the generality of this explanation by examining one of its predictions: if the number of solutions is held fixed by the choice of problems, then increased pruning should lead to a monotonic decrease in search cost. Instead, we find the easy-hard-easy pattern in median search cost even when the number of solutions is held constant, for some search methods. This generalizes previous observations of this pattern and shows that the existing theory does not explain the full range of the peak in search cost. In these cases the pattern appears to be due to changes in the size of the minimal unsolvable subproblems, rather than changing numbers of solutions.",AI,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9707101v1.pdf

Eight new maximal tractable subclasses of Allen's interval algebra are presented, some of them subsuming previously reported tractable algebras. The algebras allow for metric temporal constraints on interval starting or ending points, using the recent framework of Horn DLRs.

Lewis earlier considered such a notion of relative likelihood in the context of studying counterfactuals, but he assumed a total preference order on worlds. Complications arise when examining partial orders that are not present for total orders. There are subtleties involving the exact approach to lifting the order on worlds to an order on sets of worlds. In addition, the axiomatization of the logic of relative likelihood in the case of partial orders gives insight into the connection between relative likelihood and default reasoning.",AI,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9707103v1.pdf
9709101v1,Towards Flexible Teamwork,M. Tambe,"Many AI researchers are today striving to build agent teams for complex, dynamic multi-agent domains, with intended applications in arenas such as education, training, entertainment, information integration, and collective robotics. Unfortunately, uncertainties in these complex, dynamic domains obstruct coherent teamwork. In particular, team members often encounter differing, incomplete, and possibly inconsistent views of their environment. Furthermore, team members can unexpectedly fail in fulfilling responsibilities or discover unexpected opportunities. Highly flexible coordination and communication is key in addressing such uncertainties. Simply fitting individual agents with precomputed coordination plans will not do, for their inflexibility can cause severe failures in teamwork, and their domain-specificity hinders reusability. Our central hypothesis is that the key to such flexibility and reusability is providing agents with general models of teamwork. Agents exploit such models to autonomously reason about coordination and communication, providing requisite flexibility. Furthermore, the models enable reuse across domains, both saving implementation effort and enforcing consistency. This article presents one general, implemented model of teamwork, called STEAM. The basic building block of teamwork in STEAM is joint intentions (Cohen & Levesque, 1991b); teamwork in STEAM is based on agents' building up a (partial) hierarchy of joint intentions (this hierarchy is seen to parallel Grosz & Kraus's partial SharedPlans, 1996). Furthermore, in STEAM, team members monitor the team's and individual members' performance, reorganizing the team as necessary. Finally, decision-theoretic communication selectivity in STEAM ensures reduction in communication overheads of teamwork, with appropriate sensitivity to the environmental conditions. This article describes STEAM's application in three different complex domains, and presents detailed empirical results.",AI,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9709101v1.pdf

The result is a hierarchical representation of the original sequence, which offers insights into its lexical structure. The algorithm is driven by two constraints that reduce the size of the grammar, and produce structure as a by-product. SEQUITUR breaks new ground by operating incrementally. Moreover, the method's simple structure permits a proof that it operates in space and time that is linear in the size of the input.

9711102v1,Storing and Indexing Plan Derivations through Explanation-based Analysis   of Retrieval Failures,"L. H. Ihrig, S. Kambhampati","Case-Based Planning (CBP) provides a way of scaling up domain-independent planning to solve large problems in complex domains. It replaces the detailed and lengthy search for a solution with the retrieval and adaptation of previous planning experiences. In general, CBP has been demonstrated to improve performance over generative (from-scratch) planning. However, the performance improvements it provides are dependent on adequate judgements as to problem similarity. In particular, although CBP may substantially reduce planning effort overall, it is subject to a mis-retrieval problem. The success of CBP depends on these retrieval errors being relatively rare. This paper describes the design and implementation of a replay framework for the case-based planner DERSNLP+EBL. DERSNLP+EBL extends current CBP methodology by incorporating explanation-based learning techniques that allow it to explain and learn from the retrieval failures it encounters. These techniques are used to refine judgements about case similarity in response to feedback when a wrong decision has been made. The same failure analysis is used in building the case library, through the addition of repairing cases. Large problems are split and stored as single goal subproblems. Multi-goal problems are stored only when these smaller cases fail to be merged into a full solution. An empirical evaluation of this approach demonstrates the advantage of learning from experienced retrieval failure.",AI,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9711102v1.pdf
9711103v1,A Model Approximation Scheme for Planning in Partially Observable   Stochastic Domains,"N. L. Zhang, W. Liu","Partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) are a natural model for planning problems where effects of actions are nondeterministic and the state of the world is not completely observable. It is difficult to solve POMDPs exactly. This paper proposes a new approximation scheme. The basic idea is to transform a POMDP into another one where additional information is provided by an oracle. The oracle informs the planning agent that the current state of the world is in a certain region. The transformed POMDP is consequently said to be region observable. It is easier to solve than the original POMDP. We propose to solve the transformed POMDP and use its optimal policy to construct an approximate policy for the original POMDP. By controlling the amount of additional information that the oracle provides, it is possible to find a proper tradeoff between computational time and approximation quality. In terms of algorithmic contributions, we study in details how to exploit region observability in solving the transformed POMDP. To facilitate the study, we also propose a new exact algorithm for general POMDPs. The algorithm is conceptually simple and yet is significantly more efficient than all previous exact algorithms.",AI,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9711103v1.pdf
9711104v1,Dynamic Non-Bayesian Decision Making,"D. Monderer, M. Tennenholtz","The model of a non-Bayesian agent who faces a repeated game with incomplete information against Nature is an appropriate tool for modeling general agent-environment interactions. In such a model the environment state (controlled by Nature) may change arbitrarily, and the feedback/reward function is initially unknown. The agent is not Bayesian, that is he does not form a prior probability neither on the state selection strategy of Nature, nor on his reward function. A policy for the agent is a function which assigns an action to every history of observations and actions. Two basic feedback structures are considered. In one of them -- the perfect monitoring case -- the agent is able to observe the previous environment state as part of his feedback, while in the other -- the imperfect monitoring case -- all that is available to the agent is the reward obtained. Both of these settings refer to partially observable processes, where the current environment state is unknown. Our main result refers to the competitive ratio criterion in the perfect monitoring case. We prove the existence of an efficient stochastic policy that ensures that the competitive ratio is obtained at almost all stages with an arbitrarily high probability, where efficiency is measured in terms of rate of convergence. It is further shown that such an optimal policy does not exist in the imperfect monitoring case. Moreover, it is proved that in the perfect monitoring case there does not exist a deterministic policy that satisfies our long run optimality criterion. In addition, we discuss the maxmin criterion and prove that a deterministic efficient optimal strategy does exist in the imperfect monitoring case under this criterion. Finally we show that our approach to long-run optimality can be viewed as qualitative, which distinguishes it from previous work in this area.",AI,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9711104v1.pdf
9712101v1,When Gravity Fails: Local Search Topology,"J. Frank, P. Cheeseman, J. Stutz","Local search algorithms for combinatorial search problems frequently encounter a sequence of states in which it is impossible to improve the value of the objective function; moves through these regions, called plateau moves, dominate the time spent in local search. We analyze and characterize plateaus for three different classes of randomly generated Boolean Satisfiability problems. We identify several interesting features of plateaus that impact the performance of local search algorithms. We show that local minima tend to be small but occasionally may be very large. We also show that local minima can be escaped without unsatisfying a large number of clauses, but that systematically searching for an escape route may be computationally expensive if the local minimum is large. We show that plateaus with exits, called benches, tend to be much larger than minima, and that some benches have very few exit states which local search can use to escape. We show that the solutions (i.e., global minima) of randomly generated problem instances form clusters, which behave similarly to local minima. We revisit several enhancements of local search algorithms and explain their performance in light of our results. Finally we discuss strategies for creating the next generation of local search algorithms.",AI,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9712101v1.pdf
9712102v1,Bidirectional Heuristic Search Reconsidered,"H. Kaindl, G. Kainz","The assessment of bidirectional heuristic search has been incorrect since it was first published more than a quarter of a century ago. For quite a long time, this search strategy did not achieve the expected results, and there was a major misunderstanding about the reasons behind it. Although there is still wide-spread belief that bidirectional heuristic search is afflicted by the problem of search frontiers passing each other, we demonstrate that this conjecture is wrong. Based on this finding, we present both a new generic approach to bidirectional heuristic search and a new approach to dynamically improving heuristic values that is feasible in bidirectional search only. These approaches are put into perspective with both the traditional and more recently proposed approaches in order to facilitate a better overall understanding. Empirical results of experiments with our new approaches show that bidirectional heuristic search can be performed very efficiently and also with limited memory. These results suggest that bidirectional heuristic search appears to be better for solving certain difficult problems than corresponding unidirectional search. This provides some evidence for the usefulness of a search strategy that was long neglected. In summary, we show that bidirectional heuristic search is viable and consequently propose that it be reconsidered.",AI,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9712102v1.pdf
9801101v1,Incremental Recompilation of Knowledge,"G. Gogic, C. H. Papadimitriou, M. Sideri","Approximating a general formula from above and below by Horn formulas (its Horn envelope and Horn core, respectively) was proposed by Selman and Kautz (1991, 1996) as a form of ``knowledge compilation,'' supporting rapid approximate reasoning; on the negative side, this scheme is static in that it supports no updates, and has certain complexity drawbacks pointed out by Kavvadias, Papadimitriou and Sideri (1993). On the other hand, the many frameworks and schemes proposed in the literature for theory update and revision are plagued by serious complexity-theoretic impediments, even in the Horn case, as was pointed out by Eiter and Gottlob (1992), and is further demonstrated in the present paper. More fundamentally, these schemes are not inductive, in that they may lose in a single update any positive properties of the represented sets of formulas (small size, Horn structure, etc.). In this paper we propose a new scheme, incremental recompilation, which combines Horn approximation and model-based updates; this scheme is inductive and very efficient, free of the problems facing its constituents. A set of formulas is represented by an upper and lower Horn approximation. To update, we replace the upper Horn formula by the Horn envelope of its minimum-change update, and similarly the lower one by the Horn core of its update; the key fact which enables this scheme is that Horn envelopes and cores are easy to compute when the underlying formula is the result of a minimum-change update of a Horn formula by a clause. We conjecture that efficient algorithms are possible for more complex updates.",AI,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9801101v1.pdf
9801102v1,Monotonicity and Persistence in Preferential Logics,J. Engelfriet,"An important characteristic of many logics for Artificial Intelligence is their nonmonotonicity. This means that adding a formula to the premises can invalidate some of the consequences. There may, however, exist formulae that can always be safely added to the premises without destroying any of the consequences: we say they respect monotonicity. Also, there may be formulae that, when they are a consequence, can not be invalidated when adding any formula to the premises: we call them conservative. We study these two classes of formulae for preferential logics, and show that they are closely linked to the formulae whose truth-value is preserved along the (preferential) ordering. We will consider some preferential logics for illustration, and prove syntactic characterization results for them. The results in this paper may improve the efficiency of theorem provers for preferential logics.",AI,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9801102v1.pdf
9803101v1,Synthesizing Customized Planners from Specifications,"B. Srivastava, S. Kambhampati","Existing plan synthesis approaches in artificial intelligence fall into two categories -- domain independent and domain dependent. The domain independent approaches are applicable across a variety of domains, but may not be very efficient in any one given domain. The domain dependent approaches need to be (re)designed for each domain separately, but can be very efficient in the domain for which they are designed. One enticing alternative to these approaches is to automatically synthesize domain independent planners given the knowledge about the domain and the theory of planning. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of using existing automated software synthesis tools to support such synthesis. Specifically, we describe an architecture called CLAY in which the Kestrel Interactive Development System (KIDS) is used to derive a domain-customized planner through a semi-automatic combination of a declarative theory of planning, and the declarative control knowledge specific to a given domain, to semi-automatically combine them to derive domain-customized planners. We discuss what it means to write a declarative theory of planning and control knowledge for KIDS, and illustrate our approach by generating a class of domain-specific planners using state space refinements. Our experiments show that the synthesized planners can outperform classical refinement planners (implemented as instantiations of UCP, Kambhampati & Srivastava, 1995), using the same control knowledge. We will contrast the costs and benefits of the synthesis approach with conventional methods for customizing domain independent planners.",AI,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9803101v1.pdf
9803102v1,Cached Sufficient Statistics for Efficient Machine Learning with Large   Datasets,"A. Moore, M. S. Lee","This paper introduces new algorithms and data structures for quick counting for machine learning datasets. We focus on the counting task of constructing contingency tables, but our approach is also applicable to counting the number of records in a dataset that match conjunctive queries. Subject to certain assumptions, the costs of these operations can be shown to be independent of the number of records in the dataset and loglinear in the number of non-zero entries in the contingency table. We provide a very sparse data structure, the ADtree, to minimize memory use. We provide analytical worst-case bounds for this structure for several models of data distribution. We empirically demonstrate that tractably-sized data structures can be produced for large real-world datasets by (a) using a sparse tree structure that never allocates memory for counts of zero, (b) never allocating memory for counts that can be deduced from other counts, and (c) not bothering to expand the tree fully near its leaves. We show how the ADtree can be used to accelerate Bayes net structure finding algorithms, rule learning algorithms, and feature selection algorithms, and we provide a number of empirical results comparing ADtree methods against traditional direct counting approaches. We also discuss the possible uses of ADtrees in other machine learning methods, and discuss the merits of ADtrees in comparison with alternative representations such as kd-trees, R-trees and Frequent Sets.",AI,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9803102v1.pdf
9803103v1,Tractability of Theory Patching,"S. Argamon-Engelson, M. Koppel","In this paper we consider the problem of `theory patching', in which we are given a domain theory, some of whose components are indicated to be possibly flawed, and a set of labeled training examples for the domain concept. The theory patching problem is to revise only the indicated components of the theory, such that the resulting theory correctly classifies all the training examples. Theory patching is thus a type of theory revision in which revisions are made to individual components of the theory. Our concern in this paper is to determine for which classes of logical domain theories the theory patching problem is tractable. We consider both propositional and first-order domain theories, and show that the theory patching problem is equivalent to that of determining what information contained in a theory is `stable' regardless of what revisions might be performed to the theory. We show that determining stability is tractable if the input theory satisfies two conditions: that revisions to each theory component have monotonic effects on the classification of examples, and that theory components act independently in the classification of examples in the theory. We also show how the concepts introduced can be used to determine the soundness and completeness of particular theory patching algorithms.",AI,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9803103v1.pdf
9805101v1,Integrative Windowing,J. Fürnkranz,"In this paper we re-investigate windowing for rule learning algorithms. We show that, contrary to previous results for decision tree learning, windowing can in fact achieve significant run-time gains in noise-free domains and explain the different behavior of rule learning algorithms by the fact that they learn each rule independently. The main contribution of this paper is integrative windowing, a new type of algorithm that further exploits this property by integrating good rules into the final theory right after they have been discovered. Thus it avoids re-learning these rules in subsequent iterations of the windowing process. Experimental evidence in a variety of noise-free domains shows that integrative windowing can in fact achieve substantial run-time gains. Furthermore, we discuss the problem of noise in windowing and present an algorithm that is able to achieve run-time gains in a set of experiments in a simple domain with artificial noise.",AI,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9805101v1.pdf
9806101v1,Model-Based Diagnosis using Structured System Descriptions,A. Darwiche,"This paper presents a comprehensive approach for model-based diagnosis which includes proposals for characterizing and computing preferred diagnoses, assuming that the system description is augmented with a system structure (a directed graph explicating the interconnections between system components). Specifically, we first introduce the notion of a consequence, which is a syntactically unconstrained propositional sentence that characterizes all consistency-based diagnoses and show that standard characterizations of diagnoses, such as minimal conflicts, correspond to syntactic variations on a consequence. Second, we propose a new syntactic variation on the consequence known as negation normal form (NNF) and discuss its merits compared to standard variations. Third, we introduce a basic algorithm for computing consequences in NNF given a structured system description. We show that if the system structure does not contain cycles, then there is always a linear-size consequence in NNF which can be computed in linear time. For arbitrary system structures, we show a precise connection between the complexity of computing consequences and the topology of the underlying system structure. Finally, we present an algorithm that enumerates the preferred diagnoses characterized by a consequence. The algorithm is shown to take linear time in the size of the consequence if the preference criterion satisfies some general conditions.",AI,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9806101v1.pdf
9806102v1,A Selective Macro-learning Algorithm and its Application to the NxN   Sliding-Tile Puzzle,"L. Finkelstein, S. Markovitch","One of the most common mechanisms used for speeding up problem solvers is macro-learning. Macros are sequences of basic operators acquired during problem solving. Macros are used by the problem solver as if they were basic operators. The major problem that macro-learning presents is the vast number of macros that are available for acquisition. Macros increase the branching factor of the search space and can severely degrade problem-solving efficiency. To make macro learning useful, a program must be selective in acquiring and utilizing macros. This paper describes a general method for selective acquisition of macros. Solvable training problems are generated in increasing order of difficulty. The only macros acquired are those that take the problem solver out of a local minimum to a better state. The utility of the method is demonstrated in several domains, including the domain of NxN sliding-tile puzzles. After learning on small puzzles, the system is able to efficiently solve puzzles of any size.",AI,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9806102v1.pdf

The complexity of plan evaluation and existence varies with the plan type sought; we examine totally ordered plans, acyclic plans, and looping plans, and partially ordered plans under three natural definitions of plan value. We show that problems of interest are complete for a variety of complexity classes: PL, P, NP, co-NP, PP, NP^PP, co-NP^PP, and PSPACE. In the process of proving that certain planning problems are complete for NP^PP, we introduce a new basic NP^PP-complete problem, E-MAJSAT, which generalizes the standard Boolean satisfiability problem to computations involving probabilistic quantities; our results suggest that the development of good heuristics for E-MAJSAT could be important for the creation of efficient algorithms for a wide variety of problems.",AI,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9808101v1.pdf

Rather than reasoning about the world it is planning for, SYNERGY uses artificial selection, recombination and fitness measure to generate linear plans that solve conjunctive goals. We ran SYNERGY on several domains (e.g., the briefcase problem and a few variants of the robot navigation problem), and the experimental results show that our planner is capable of handling problem instances that are one to two orders of magnitude larger than the ones solved by UCPOP. In order to facilitate the search reduction and to enhance the expressive power of SYNERGY, we also propose two major extensions to our planning system: a formalism for using hierarchical planning operators, and a framework for planning in dynamic environments.",AI,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9810016v1.pdf

Additionally, the problems often have to observe vaguely specified constraints of different importance, the available data may be uncertain, and compromises between antagonistic criteria may be necessary. We present a combination of approximate reasoning based constraints and iterative optimization based heuristics that help to model and solve such problems in a framework of C++ software libraries called StarFLIP++.

9903016v1,"Modeling Belief in Dynamic Systems, Part II: Revision and Update","N Friedman, J. Y. Halpern","The study of belief change has been an active area in philosophy and AI. In recent years two special cases of belief change, belief revision and belief update, have been studied in detail. In a companion paper (Friedman & Halpern, 1997), we introduce a new framework to model belief change. This framework combines temporal and epistemic modalities with a notion of plausibility, allowing us to examine the change of beliefs over time. In this paper, we show how belief revision and belief update can be captured in our framework. This allows us to compare the assumptions made by each method, and to better understand the principles underlying them. In particular, it shows that Katsuno and Mendelzon's notion of belief update (Katsuno & Mendelzon, 1991a) depends on several strong assumptions that may limit its applicability in artificial intelligence. Finally, our analysis allow us to identify a notion of minimal change that underlies a broad range of belief change operations including revision and update.",AI,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9903016v1.pdf
9910016v1,Probabilistic Agent Programs,"Juergen Dix, Mirco Nanni, VS Subrahmanian","Agents are small programs that autonomously take actions based on changes in their environment or ``state.'' Over the last few years, there have been an increasing number of efforts to build agents that can interact and/or collaborate with other agents. In one of these efforts, Eiter, Subrahmanian amd Pick (AIJ, 108(1-2), pages 179-255) have shown how agents may be built on top of legacy code. However, their framework assumes that agent states are completely determined, and there is no uncertainty in an agent's state. Thus, their framework allows an agent developer to specify how his agents will react when the agent is 100% sure about what is true/false in the world state. In this paper, we propose the concept of a \emph{probabilistic agent program} and show how, given an arbitrary program written in any imperative language, we may build a declarative ``probabilistic'' agent program on top of it which supports decision making in the presence of uncertainty. We provide two alternative semantics for probabilistic agent programs. We show that the second semantics, though more epistemically appealing, is more complex to compute. We provide sound and complete algorithms to compute the semantics of \emph{positive} agent programs.",AI,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9910016v1.pdf

0002002v1,Uniform semantic treatment of default and autoepistemic logics,"Marc Denecker, Victor W. Marek, Miroslaw Truszczynski","We revisit the issue of connections between two leading formalisms in nonmonotonic reasoning: autoepistemic logic and default logic. For each logic we develop a comprehensive semantic framework based on the notion of a belief pair. The set of all belief pairs together with the so called knowledge ordering forms a complete lattice. For each logic, we introduce several semantics by means of fixpoints of operators on the lattice of belief pairs. Our results elucidate an underlying isomorphism of the respective semantic constructions. In particular, we show that the interpretation of defaults as modal formulas proposed by Konolige allows us to represent all semantics for default logic in terms of the corresponding semantics for autoepistemic logic. Thus, our results conclusively establish that default logic can indeed be viewed as a fragment of autoepistemic logic. However, as we also demonstrate, the semantics of Moore and Reiter are given by different operators and occupy different locations in their corresponding families of semantics. This result explains the source of the longstanding difficulty to formally relate these two semantics. In the paper, we also discuss approximating skeptical reasoning with autoepistemic and default logics and establish constructive principles behind such approximations.",AI,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0002002v1.pdf
0002003v1,On the accuracy and running time of GSAT,"Deborah East, Miroslaw Truszczynski","Randomized algorithms for deciding satisfiability were shown to be effective in solving problems with thousands of variables. However, these algorithms are not complete. That is, they provide no guarantee that a satisfying assignment, if one exists, will be found. Thus, when studying randomized algorithms, there are two important characteristics that need to be considered: the running time and, even more importantly, the accuracy --- a measure of likelihood that a satisfying assignment will be found, provided one exists. In fact, we argue that without a reference to the accuracy, the notion of the running time for randomized algorithms is not well-defined. In this paper, we introduce a formal notion of accuracy. We use it to define a concept of the running time. We use both notions to study the random walk strategy GSAT algorithm. We investigate the dependence of accuracy on properties of input formulas such as clause-to-variable ratio and the number of satisfying assignments. We demonstrate that the running time of GSAT grows exponentially in the number of variables of the input formula for randomly generated 3-CNF formulas and for the formulas encoding 3- and 4-colorability of graphs.",AI,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0002003v1.pdf
0002009v1,Syntactic Autonomy: Why There is no Autonomy without Symbols and How   Self-Organization Might Evolve Them,Luis M. Rocha,"Two different types of agency are discussed based on dynamically coherent and incoherent couplings with an environment respectively. I propose that until a private syntax (syntactic autonomy) is discovered by dynamically coherent agents, there are no significant or interesting types of closure or autonomy. When syntactic autonomy is established, then, because of a process of description-based selected self-organization, open-ended evolution is enabled. At this stage, agents depend, in addition to dynamics, on localized, symbolic memory, thus adding a level of dynamical incoherence to their interaction with the environment. Furthermore, it is the appearance of syntactic autonomy which enables much more interesting types of closures amongst agents which share the same syntax. To investigate how we can study the emergence of syntax from dynamical systems, experiments with cellular automata leading to emergent computation to solve non-trivial tasks are discussed. RNA editing is also mentioned as a process that may have been used to obtain a primordial biological code necessary open-ended evolution.",AI,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0002009v1.pdf

If an added rule is inconsistent with a program, that is, if it leads to a situation such that no stable model exists for a new program, then deletion and addition of rules are performed to avoid inconsistency. We specify a revision by translating a normal logic program into an abductive logic program with abducibles to represent deletion and addition of rules. To compute such deletion and addition, we propose an adaptation of our top-down abductive proof procedure to compute a relevant abducibles to an added rule. We compute a minimally revised program, by choosing a minimal set of abducibles among all the sets of abducibles computed by a top-down proof procedure.",AI,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0003008v1.pdf

In ACLP, the task of abduction is supported and enhanced by its non-trivial integration with constraint solving facilitating its application to complex problems. The ACLP system is currently implemented on top of the CLP language of ECLiPSe as a meta-interpreter exploiting its underlying constraint solver for finite domains. It has been applied to the problems of planning and scheduling in order to test its computational effectiveness compared with the direct use of the (lower level) constraint solving framework of CLP on which it is built. These experiments provide evidence that the abductive framework of ACLP does not compromise significantly the computational efficiency of the solutions.

Our model uses a finite, logically open sequence of propositional formulas as a representation for beliefs and defines a notion of inference from maxiconsistent subsets of formulas guided by two orderings: a temporal sequencing and an ordering based on relevance relations between the conclusion and formulas in the sequence. The relevance relations are ternary (using context as a parameter) as opposed to standard binary axiomatizations. The inference operation thus defined easily handles iterated revision by maintaining a revision history, blocks the derivation of inconsistent answers from a possibly inconsistent sequence and maintains the distinction between explicit and implicit beliefs. In doing so, it provides a finitely presented formalism and a plausible model of reasoning for automated agents.",AI,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0003021v1.pdf

An ordered logic program is transformed into a second, regular, extended logic program wherein the preferences are respected, in that the answer sets obtained in the transformed theory correspond with the preferred answer sets of the original theory.

This approach to belief change is founded on notions such as optimal context and accessibility. For the sentential model of belief states we provide both a formal description of contexts as sub-theories determined by three parameters and a method to construct contexts. Next, we introduce an accessibility ordering for belief sets, which we then use for selecting the best (optimal) contexts with respect to the processing effort involved in the revision. Then, for finitely axiomatizable knowledge bases, we characterize a finite accessibility ranking from which the accessibility ordering for the entire base is generated and show how to determine the ranking of an arbitrary sentence in the language.

0003032v1,cc-Golog: Towards More Realistic Logic-Based Robot Controllers,"Henrik Grosskreutz, Gerhard Lakemeyer","High-level robot controllers in realistic domains typically deal with processes which operate concurrently, change the world continuously, and where the execution of actions is event-driven as in ``charge the batteries as soon as the voltage level is low''. While non-logic-based robot control languages are well suited to express such scenarios, they fare poorly when it comes to projecting, in a conspicuous way, how the world evolves when actions are executed. On the other hand, a logic-based control language like \congolog, based on the situation calculus, is well-suited for the latter. However, it has problems expressing event-driven behavior. In this paper, we show how these problems can be overcome by first extending the situation calculus to support continuous change and event-driven behavior and then presenting \ccgolog, a variant of \congolog which is based on the extended situation calculus. One benefit of \ccgolog is that it narrows the gap in expressiveness compared to non-logic-based control languages while preserving a semantically well-founded projection mechanism.",AI,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0003032v1.pdf

The system derives sceptical non-monotonic consequences of a given reformulated theory which exactly correspond to consequences entailed by E's model-theory. The computation relies on a complimentary ability of the system to derive credulous non-monotonic consequences together with a set of supporting assumptions which is sufficient for the (credulous) conclusion to hold. E-RES allows theories to contain general action laws, statements about action occurrences, observations and statements of ramifications (or universal laws).

Dietterich,"This paper presents the MAXQ approach to hierarchical reinforcement learning based on decomposing the target Markov decision process (MDP) into a hierarchy of smaller MDPs and decomposing the value function of the target MDP into an additive combination of the value functions of the smaller MDPs. The paper defines the MAXQ hierarchy, proves formal results on its representational power, and establishes five conditions for the safe use of state abstractions. The paper presents an online model-free learning algorithm, MAXQ-Q, and proves that it converges wih probability 1 to a kind of locally-optimal policy known as a recursively optimal policy, even in the presence of the five kinds of state abstraction. The paper evaluates the MAXQ representation and MAXQ-Q through a series of experiments in three domains and shows experimentally that MAXQ-Q (with state abstractions) converges to a recursively optimal policy much faster than flat Q learning. The fact that MAXQ learns a representation of the value function has an important benefit: it makes it possible to compute and execute an improved, non-hierarchical policy via a procedure similar to the policy improvement step of policy iteration. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of this non-hierarchical execution experimentally. Finally, the paper concludes with a comparison to related work and a discussion of the design tradeoffs in hierarchical reinforcement learning.",ML,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9905014v1.pdf

The multiplicative updating rule here constructed is natural from the homogeneous nature of the Lie group and has numerous merits for the rigorous treatment of the dynamics. As one consequence, the second order convergence is shown. For the cost function, functions invariant under the componentwise scaling are choosen. By identifying points which can be transformed to each other by the scaling, we assume that the dynamics is in a coset space. In our method, a point can move toward any direction in this coset. Thus, no prewhitening is required.",ML,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0002006v1.pdf
0009001v3,Complexity analysis for algorithmically simple strings,Andrei N. Soklakov,"Given a reference computer, Kolmogorov complexity is a well defined function on all binary strings. In the standard approach, however, only the asymptotic properties of such functions are considered because they do not depend on the reference computer. We argue that this approach can be more useful if it is refined to include an important practical case of simple binary strings. Kolmogorov complexity calculus may be developed for this case if we restrict the class of available reference computers. The interesting problem is to define a class of computers which is restricted in a {\it natural} way modeling the real-life situation where only a limited class of computers is physically available to us. We give an example of what such a natural restriction might look like mathematically, and show that under such restrictions some error terms, even logarithmic in complexity, can disappear from the standard complexity calculus.

0009007v1,Robust Classification for Imprecise Environments,"Foster Provost, Tom Fawcett","In real-world environments it usually is difficult to specify target operating conditions precisely, for example, target misclassification costs. This uncertainty makes building robust classification systems problematic. We show that it is possible to build a hybrid classifier that will perform at least as well as the best available classifier for any target conditions. In some cases, the performance of the hybrid actually can surpass that of the best known classifier. This robust performance extends across a wide variety of comparison frameworks, including the optimization of metrics such as accuracy, expected cost, lift, precision, recall, and workforce utilization. The hybrid also is efficient to build, to store, and to update. The hybrid is based on a method for the comparison of classifier performance that is robust to imprecise class distributions and misclassification costs. The ROC convex hull (ROCCH) method combines techniques from ROC analysis, decision analysis and computational geometry, and adapts them to the particulars of analyzing learned classifiers. The method is efficient and incremental, minimizes the management of classifier performance data, and allows for clear visual comparisons and sensitivity analyses. Finally, we point to empirical evidence that a robust hybrid classifier indeed is needed for many real-world problems.",ML,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0009007v1.pdf

0011044v1,Scaling Up Inductive Logic Programming by Learning from Interpretations,"Hendrik Blockeel, Luc De Raedt, Nico Jacobs, Bart Demoen","When comparing inductive logic programming (ILP) and attribute-value learning techniques, there is a trade-off between expressive power and efficiency. Inductive logic programming techniques are typically more expressive but also less efficient. Therefore, the data sets handled by current inductive logic programming systems are small according to general standards within the data mining community. The main source of inefficiency lies in the assumption that several examples may be related to each other, so they cannot be handled independently.   Within the learning from interpretations framework for inductive logic programming this assumption is unnecessary, which allows to scale up existing ILP algorithms. In this paper we explain this learning setting in the context of relational databases. We relate the setting to propositional data mining and to the classical ILP setting, and show that learning from interpretations corresponds to learning from multiple relations and thus extends the expressiveness of propositional learning, while maintaining its efficiency to a large extent (which is not the case in the classical ILP setting).   As a case study, we present two alternative implementations of the ILP system Tilde (Top-down Induction of Logical DEcision trees): Tilde-classic, which loads all data in main memory, and Tilde-LDS, which loads the examples one by one. We experimentally compare the implementations, showing Tilde-LDS can handle large data sets (in the order of 100,000 examples or 100 MB) and indeed scales up linearly in the number of examples.",ML,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0011044v1.pdf

In this paper, we explore a {\it stigmergic} approach, in which the agent's actions include the ability to set and clear bits in an external memory, and the external memory is included as part of the input to the agent. In this case, we need to learn a reactive policy in a highly non-Markovian domain. We explore two algorithms: SARSA(\lambda), which has had empirical success in partially observable domains, and VAPS, a new algorithm due to Baird and Moore, with convergence guarantees in partially observable domains. We compare the performance of these two algorithms on benchmark problems.",ML,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0103003v1.pdf

In this paper we show that, for decision trees, the computational overhead of cross-validation can be reduced significantly by integrating the cross-validation with the normal decision tree induction process. We discuss how existing decision tree algorithms can be adapted to this aim, and provide an analysis of the speedups these adaptations may yield.

In this paper, we make use of a parametric model of kernel matrices, and estimate missing entries by fitting the model to existing entries. The parametric model is created as a set of spectral variants of a complete kernel matrix derived from another information source. For model fitting, we adopt the em algorithm based on the information geometry of positive definite matrices.

0309015v1,Reliable and Efficient Inference of Bayesian Networks from Sparse Data   by Statistical Learning Theory,"Dominik Janzing, Daniel Herrmann","To learn (statistical) dependencies among random variables requires exponentially large sample size in the number of observed random variables if any arbitrary joint probability distribution can occur.   We consider the case that sparse data strongly suggest that the probabilities can be described by a simple Bayesian network, i.e., by a graph with small in-degree \Delta. Then this simple law will also explain further data with high confidence. This is shown by calculating bounds on the VC dimension of the set of those probability measures that correspond to simple graphs. This allows to select networks by structural risk minimization and gives reliability bounds on the error of the estimated joint measure without (in contrast to a previous paper) any prior assumptions on the set of possible joint measures.   The complexity for searching the optimal Bayesian networks of in-degree \Delta increases only polynomially in the number of random varibales for constant \Delta and the optimal joint measure associated with a given graph can be found by convex optimization.",ML,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0309015v1.pdf
0311042v1,Toward Attribute Efficient Learning Algorithms,"Adam R. Klivans, Rocco A. Servedio","We make progress on two important problems regarding attribute efficient learnability.   First, we give an algorithm for learning decision lists of length $k$ over $n$ variables using $2^{\tilde{O}(k^{1/3})} \log n$ examples and time $n^{\tilde{O}(k^{1/3})}$. This is the first algorithm for learning decision lists that has both subexponential sample complexity and subexponential running time in the relevant parameters. Our approach establishes a relationship between attribute efficient learning and polynomial threshold functions and is based on a new construction of low degree, low weight polynomial threshold functions for decision lists. For a wide range of parameters our construction matches a 1994 lower bound due to Beigel for the ODDMAXBIT predicate and gives an essentially optimal tradeoff between polynomial threshold function degree and weight.   Second, we give an algorithm for learning an unknown parity function on $k$ out of $n$ variables using $O(n^{1-1/k})$ examples in time polynomial in $n$. For $k=o(\log n)$ this yields a polynomial time algorithm with sample complexity $o(n)$.

An important application lies in most monitoring purposes, which require analyzing large sets of time-series for learning usual patterns. Any deviation from this learned profile is then considered as an unexpected situation. Moreover, complex applications may involve the temporal study of several heterogeneous parameters. In that paper, we propose a method for mining heterogeneous multivariate time-series for learning meaningful patterns. The proposed approach allows for mixed time-series -- containing both pattern and non-pattern data -- such as for imprecise matches, outliers, stretching and global translating of patterns instances in time. We present the early results of our approach in the context of monitoring the health status of a person at home.

We shall call the algorithm `stable' if, when y_i is a noisy version of f*(x_i) for some function f* in H, the output of the algorithm converges to f* as the regularization term and noise simultaneously vanish. We consider two flavors of this problem, one where a data set of N points remains fixed, and the other where N -> infinity. For the case where N -> infinity, we give conditions for convergence to f_E (the function which is the expectation of y(x) for each x), as lambda -> 0. For the fixed N case, we describe the limiting 'non-noisy', 'non-regularized' function f*, and give conditions for convergence. In the process, we develop a set of tools for dealing with functionals such as L(f), which are applicable to many other problems in learning theory.",ML,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0502016v1.pdf

To prove our result, we analyze the topological structure of the probability hierarchy. We prove that it is well-ordered in descending ordering and order-equivalent to ordinal epsilon_0. This shows that the structure of the hierarchy is very complicated.   Using similar methods, we also prove that, for PFIN-type learning, team learning and probabilistic learning are of the same power.",ML,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0504001v1.pdf

Forecasting is formalized as a game between three players: Reality, whose role is to generate observations; Forecaster, whose goal is to predict the observations; and Skeptic, who tries to make money on any lack of agreement between Forecaster's predictions and the actual observations. Our main mathematical result is that for any continuous strategy for Skeptic in a linear protocol there exists a strategy for Forecaster that does not allow Skeptic's capital to grow. This result is a meta-theorem that allows one to transform any continuous law of probability in a linear protocol into a forecasting strategy whose predictions are guaranteed to satisfy this law. We apply this meta-theorem to a weak law of large numbers in Hilbert spaces to obtain a version of the K29 prediction algorithm for linear protocols and show that this version also satisfies the attractive properties of proper calibration and resolution under a suitable choice of its kernel parameter, with no assumptions about the way the data is generated.",ML,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0506007v2.pdf

This methodology is a template procedure which can be applied on most kernels on measures and takes advantage of a more detailed ""bag of components"" representation of the objects. To obtain such a detailed description, we consider possible decompositions of the original bag into a collection of nested bags, following a prior knowledge on the objects' structure. We then consider these smaller bags to compare two objects both in a detailed perspective, stressing local matches between the smaller bags, and in a global or coarse perspective, by considering the entire bag. This multiresolution approach is likely to be best suited for tasks where the coarse approach is not precise enough, and where a more subtle mixture of both local and global similarities is necessary to compare objects. The approach presented here would not be computationally tractable without a factorization trick that we introduce before presenting promising results on an image retrieval task.",ML,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0507033v2.pdf

We prove loss bounds against an adaptive adversary. From this, we obtain a master algorithm for ""reactive"" experts problems, which means that the master's actions may influence the behavior of the adversary. Our algorithm can significantly outperform standard experts algorithms on such problems. Finally, we combine it with a universal expert class. The resulting universal learner performs -- in a certain sense -- almost as well as any computable strategy, for any online decision problem.

In partial observation cases, it was not clear how to obtain performance guarantees against adaptive adversary, without worsening the bounds. We propose a conceptually simple argument to resolve this problem. Using this, a regret bound of O(t^(2/3)) for FPL in the adversarial multi-armed bandit problem is shown. This bound holds for the common FPL variant using only the observations from designated exploration rounds. Using all observations allows for the stronger bound of O(t^(1/2)), matching the best bound known so far (and essentially the known lower bound) for adversarial bandits. Surprisingly, this variant does not even need explicit exploration, it is self-stabilizing. However the sampling probabilities have to be either externally provided or approximated to sufficient accuracy, using O(t^2 log t) samples in each step.",ML,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0507062v1.pdf
0509055v1,Learning Optimal Augmented Bayes Networks,"Vikas Hamine, Paul Helman","Naive Bayes is a simple Bayesian classifier with strong independence assumptions among the attributes. This classifier, desipte its strong independence assumptions, often performs well in practice. It is believed that relaxing the independence assumptions of a naive Bayes classifier may improve the classification accuracy of the resulting structure. While finding an optimal unconstrained Bayesian Network (for most any reasonable scoring measure) is an NP-hard problem, it is possible to learn in polynomial time optimal networks obeying various structural restrictions. Several authors have examined the possibilities of adding augmenting arcs between attributes of a Naive Bayes classifier. Friedman, Geiger and Goldszmidt define the TAN structure in which the augmenting arcs form a tree on the attributes, and present a polynomial time algorithm that learns an optimal TAN with respect to MDL score. Keogh and Pazzani define Augmented Bayes Networks in which the augmenting arcs form a forest on the attributes (a collection of trees, hence a relaxation of the stuctural restriction of TAN), and present heuristic search methods for learning good, though not optimal, augmenting arc sets. The authors, however, evaluate the learned structure only in terms of observed misclassification error and not against a scoring metric, such as MDL. In this paper, we present a simple, polynomial time greedy algorithm for learning an optimal Augmented Bayes Network with respect to MDL score.",ML,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0509055v1.pdf

The prediction algorithm's performance is measured by the squared deviation of the predictions from the actual labels. No stochastic assumptions are made about the way the labels and objects are generated. Instead, we are given a benchmark class of prediction rules some of which are hoped to produce good predictions. We show that for a wide range of infinite-dimensional benchmark classes one can construct a prediction algorithm whose cumulative loss over the first N examples does not exceed the cumulative loss of any prediction rule in the class plus O(sqrt(N)); the main differences from the known results are that we do not impose any upper bound on the norm of the considered prediction rules and that we achieve an optimal leading term in the excess loss of our algorithm. If the benchmark class is ""universal"" (dense in the class of continuous functions on each compact set), this provides an on-line non-stochastic analogue of universally consistent prediction in non-parametric statistics.

The bound is tight, as the proof leads to a simple algorithm which meets it. We further establish a bound on the total regret, E[ sum_{i=1..t} (x_i - x*)^2 ] >= O(sqrt(t)) These bounds may impose practical limitations on an agent's performance, as O(eps^-4) queries are made before the queries converge to x* with eps accuracy.",ML,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0511088v1.pdf

Rational stochastic languages have minimal normal representation which may be very concise, and whose parameters can be efficiently estimated from stochastic samples. We design an efficient inference algorithm DEES which aims at building a minimal normal representation of the target. Despite the fact that no recursively enumerable class of MA computes exactly the set of rational stochastic languages over Q, we show that DEES strongly identifies tis set in the limit.

In this paper we make this observation precise by identifying risk bounds of a classifier in terms of the quality of the estimates of the label class distributions. We show how PAC learnability relates to estimates of the distributions that have a PAC guarantee on their $L_1$ distance from the true distribution, and we bound the increase in negative log likelihood risk in terms of PAC bounds on the KL-divergence. We give an inefficient but general-purpose smoothing method for converting an estimated distribution that is good under the $L_1$ metric into a distribution that is good under the KL-divergence.",ML,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0607047v1.pdf
0607067v1,Competing with stationary prediction strategies,Vladimir Vovk,"In this paper we introduce the class of stationary prediction strategies and construct a prediction algorithm that asymptotically performs as well as the best continuous stationary strategy. We make mild compactness assumptions but no stochastic assumptions about the environment. In particular, no assumption of stationarity is made about the environment, and the stationarity of the considered strategies only means that they do not depend explicitly on time; we argue that it is natural to consider only stationary strategies even for highly non-stationary environments.",ML,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0607067v1.pdf
0607085v2,Using Pseudo-Stochastic Rational Languages in Probabilistic Grammatical   Inference,"Amaury Habrard, Francois Denis, Yann Esposito","In probabilistic grammatical inference, a usual goal is to infer a good approximation of an unknown distribution P called a stochastic language. The estimate of P stands in some class of probabilistic models such as probabilistic automata (PA). In this paper, we focus on probabilistic models based on multiplicity automata (MA). The stochastic languages generated by MA are called rational stochastic languages; they strictly include stochastic languages generated by PA; they also admit a very concise canonical representation. Despite the fact that this class is not recursively enumerable, it is efficiently identifiable in the limit by using the algorithm DEES, introduced by the authors in a previous paper. However, the identification is not proper and before the convergence of the algorithm, DEES can produce MA that do not define stochastic languages. Nevertheless, it is possible to use these MA to define stochastic languages. We show that they belong to a broader class of rational series, that we call pseudo-stochastic rational languages. The aim of this paper is twofold. First we provide a theoretical study of pseudo-stochastic rational languages, the languages output by DEES, showing for example that this class is decidable within polynomial time. Second, we have carried out a lot of experiments in order to compare DEES to classical inference algorithms such as ALERGIA and MDI. They show that DEES outperforms them in most cases.",ML,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0607085v2.pdf
0607096v1,Logical settings for concept learning from incomplete examples in First   Order Logic,"Dominique Bouthinon, Henry Soldano, Véronique Ventos","We investigate here concept learning from incomplete examples. Our first purpose is to discuss to what extent logical learning settings have to be modified in order to cope with data incompleteness. More precisely we are interested in extending the learning from interpretations setting introduced by L. De Raedt that extends to relational representations the classical propositional (or attribute-value) concept learning from examples framework. We are inspired here by ideas presented by H. Hirsh in a work extending the Version space inductive paradigm to incomplete data. H. Hirsh proposes to slightly modify the notion of solution when dealing with incomplete examples: a solution has to be a hypothesis compatible with all pieces of information concerning the examples. We identify two main classes of incompleteness. First, uncertainty deals with our state of knowledge concerning an example. Second, generalization (or abstraction) deals with what part of the description of the example is sufficient for the learning purpose. These two main sources of incompleteness can be mixed up when only part of the useful information is known. We discuss a general learning setting, referred to as ""learning from possibilities"" that formalizes these ideas, then we present a more specific learning setting, referred to as ""assumption-based learning"" that cope with examples which uncertainty can be reduced when considering contextual information outside of the proper description of the examples. Assumption-based learning is illustrated on a recent work concerning the prediction of a consensus secondary structure common to a set of RNA sequences.",ML,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0607096v1.pdf

""Nested tree,"" ""embedded tree"" and ""recursive tree"" are also appropriate names for this algorithm, which is one of our contributions. Our other contribution is the theoretical analysis of the algorithms, in which we give training error bounds.

More specifically, for any class of prediction strategies constituting a reproducing kernel Hilbert space we construct a leading strategy, in the sense that the loss of any prediction strategy whose norm is not too large is determined by how closely it imitates the leading strategy. This result is extended to the loss functions given by Bregman divergences and by strictly proper scoring rules.",ML,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0607134v1.pdf

Then we present Lambek grammars, a formalism issued from categorial grammars which, although not as expressive as needed for a full formalization of natural languages, is particularly suited to easily implement a natural interface between syntax and semantics.

The local rules are considered as projections of the global classification rules to the event we want to classify. A massive global optimization algorithm is used for optimization of quality criterion. The algorithm, which has polynomial complexity in typical case, is used to find all high--quality local rules. The other distinctive feature of the algorithm is the integration of attributes levels selection (for ordered attributes) with rules searching and original conflicting rules resolution strategy. The algorithm is practical; it was tested on a number of data sets from UCI repository, and a comparison with the other predicting techniques is presented.",ML,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0609007v1.pdf

The predictor's goal is to compete with a benchmark class of prediction rules, which is often a proper Banach function space. Metric entropy provides a unifying framework for competitive on-line prediction: the numerous known upper bounds on the metric entropy of various compact sets in function spaces readily imply bounds on the performance of on-line prediction strategies.

Servedio","We propose and analyze a new vantage point for the learning of mixtures of Gaussians: namely, the PAC-style model of learning probability distributions introduced by Kearns et al. Here the task is to construct a hypothesis mixture of Gaussians that is statistically indistinguishable from the actual mixture generating the data; specifically, the KL-divergence should be at most epsilon.   In this scenario, we give a poly(n/epsilon)-time algorithm that learns the class of mixtures of any constant number of axis-aligned Gaussians in n-dimensional Euclidean space. Our algorithm makes no assumptions about the separation between the means of the Gaussians, nor does it have any dependence on the minimum mixing weight. This is in contrast to learning results known in the ``clustering'' model, where such assumptions are unavoidable.   Our algorithm relies on the method of moments, and a subalgorithm developed in previous work by the authors (FOCS 2005) for a discrete mixture-learning problem.",ML,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0609093v1.pdf

This paper describes a new technique for ""hedging"" the predictions output by many such algorithms, including support vector machines, kernel ridge regression, kernel nearest neighbours, and by many other state-of-the-art methods. The hedged predictions for the labels of new objects include quantitative measures of their own accuracy and reliability. These measures are provably valid under the assumption of randomness, traditional in machine learning: the objects and their labels are assumed to be generated independently from the same probability distribution. In particular, it becomes possible to control (up to statistical fluctuations) the number of erroneous predictions by selecting a suitable confidence level. Validity being achieved automatically, the remaining goal of hedged prediction is efficiency: taking full account of the new objects' features and other available information to produce as accurate predictions as possible. This can be done successfully using the powerful machinery of modern machine learning.",ML,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0611011v1.pdf

It provides a unified view of algorithms such as TD(lambda), LSTD(lambda), iLSTD, residual-gradient TD. It is asserted that they all consist in minimizing a gradient function and differ by the form of this function and their means of minimizing it. Two new schemes are introduced in that framework: Full-gradient TD which uses a generalization of the principle introduced in iLSTD, and EGD TD, which reduces the gradient by successive equi-gradient descents. These three algorithms form a new intermediate family with the interesting property of making much better use of the samples than TD while keeping a gradient descent scheme, which is useful for complexity issues and optimistic policy iteration.",ML,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0611145v1.pdf
0703062v1,Bandit Algorithms for Tree Search,"Pierre-Arnaud Coquelin, Rémi Munos","Bandit based methods for tree search have recently gained popularity when applied to huge trees, e.g. in the game of go (Gelly et al., 2006). The UCT algorithm (Kocsis and Szepesvari, 2006), a tree search method based on Upper Confidence Bounds (UCB) (Auer et al., 2002), is believed to adapt locally to the effective smoothness of the tree. However, we show that UCT is too ``optimistic'' in some cases, leading to a regret O(exp(exp(D))) where D is the depth of the tree. We propose alternative bandit algorithms for tree search. First, a modification of UCT using a confidence sequence that scales exponentially with the horizon depth is proven to have a regret O(2^D \sqrt{n}), but does not adapt to possible smoothness in the tree. We then analyze Flat-UCB performed on the leaves and provide a finite regret bound with high probability. Then, we introduce a UCB-based Bandit Algorithm for Smooth Trees which takes into account actual smoothness of the rewards for performing efficient ``cuts'' of sub-optimal branches with high confidence. Finally, we present an incremental tree search version which applies when the full tree is too big (possibly infinite) to be entirely represented and show that with high probability, essentially only the optimal branches is indefinitely developed. We illustrate these methods on a global optimization problem of a Lipschitz function, given noisy data.",ML,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0703062v1.pdf
0703125v1,Intrinsic dimension of a dataset: what properties does one expect?,Vladimir Pestov,"We propose an axiomatic approach to the concept of an intrinsic dimension of a dataset, based on a viewpoint of geometry of high-dimensional structures. Our first axiom postulates that high values of dimension be indicative of the presence of the curse of dimensionality (in a certain precise mathematical sense). The second axiom requires the dimension to depend smoothly on a distance between datasets (so that the dimension of a dataset and that of an approximating principal manifold would be close to each other). The third axiom is a normalization condition: the dimension of the Euclidean $n$-sphere $\s^n$ is $\Theta(n)$. We give an example of a dimension function satisfying our axioms, even though it is in general computationally unfeasible, and discuss a computationally cheap function satisfying most but not all of our axioms (the ``intrinsic dimensionality'' of Ch\'avez et al.)",ML,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0703125v1.pdf

Rajnarayan","This paper uncovers and explores the close relationship between Monte Carlo Optimization of a parametrized integral (MCO), Parametric machine-Learning (PL), and `blackbox' or `oracle'-based optimization (BO). We make four contributions. First, we prove that MCO is mathematically identical to a broad class of PL problems. This identity potentially provides a new application domain for all broadly applicable PL techniques: MCO. Second, we introduce immediate sampling, a new version of the Probability Collectives (PC) algorithm for blackbox optimization. Immediate sampling transforms the original BO problem into an MCO problem. Accordingly, by combining these first two contributions, we can apply all PL techniques to BO. In our third contribution we validate this way of improving BO by demonstrating that cross-validation and bagging improve immediate sampling. Finally, conventional MC and MCO procedures ignore the relationship between the sample point locations and the associated values of the integrand; only the values of the integrand at those locations are considered. We demonstrate that one can exploit the sample location information using PL techniques, for example by forming a fit of the sample locations to the associated values of the integrand. This provides an additional way to apply PL techniques to improve MCO.",ML,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.1274v1.pdf

We also compare the linear and non-linear merging techniques for the sub-bands recognizer. Support vector machines and Gaussian Mixture models are the non-linear merging techniques that are investigated.

This problem, referred to as the group Lasso, extends the usual regularization by the 1-norm where all spaces have dimension one, where it is commonly referred to as the Lasso. In this paper, we study the asymptotic model consistency of the group Lasso. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions for the consistency of group Lasso under practical assumptions, such as model misspecification. When the linear predictors and Euclidean norms are replaced by functions and reproducing kernel Hilbert norms, the problem is usually referred to as multiple kernel learning and is commonly used for learning from heterogeneous data sources and for non linear variable selection. Using tools from functional analysis, and in particular covariance operators, we extend the consistency results to this infinite dimensional case and also propose an adaptive scheme to obtain a consistent model estimate, even when the necessary condition required for the non adaptive scheme is not satisfied.",ML,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0707.3390v2.pdf
0708.1242v3,Cost-minimising strategies for data labelling : optimal stopping and   active learning,"Christos Dimitrakakis, Christian Savu-Krohn","Supervised learning deals with the inference of a distribution over an output or label space $\CY$ conditioned on points in an observation space $\CX$, given a training dataset $D$ of pairs in $\CX \times \CY$. However, in a lot of applications of interest, acquisition of large amounts of observations is easy, while the process of generating labels is time-consuming or costly. One way to deal with this problem is {\em active} learning, where points to be labelled are selected with the aim of creating a model with better performance than that of an model trained on an equal number of randomly sampled points. In this paper, we instead propose to deal with the labelling cost directly: The learning goal is defined as the minimisation of a cost which is a function of the expected model performance and the total cost of the labels used. This allows the development of general strategies and specific algorithms for (a) optimal stopping, where the expected cost dictates whether label acquisition should continue (b) empirical evaluation, where the cost is used as a performance metric for a given combination of inference, stopping and sampling methods. Though the main focus of the paper is optimal stopping, we also aim to provide the background for further developments and discussion in the related field of active learning.",ML,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0708.1242v3.pdf

This paper analyzes demonstrates several additional properties of that conditional distribution. The paper first shows that we can reconstruct, up to class labels, the class posterior distribution $P(\omega|x)$ given $P(\omega\eq\omega'|x,x')$, gives a procedure for recovering the class labels, and gives an asymptotically Bayes-optimal classification procedure. It also shows, given such an optimal similarity measure, how to construct a classifier that outperforms the nearest neighbor classifier and achieves Bayes-optimal classification rates. The paper then analyzes Bayesian similarity in a framework where a classifier faces a number of related classification tasks (multitask learning) and illustrates that reconstruction of the class posterior distribution is not possible in general. Finally, the paper identifies a distinct class of classification problems using $P(\omega\eq\omega'|x,x')$ and shows that using $P(\omega\eq\omega'|x,x')$ to solve those problems is the Bayes optimal solution.",ML,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0712.0130v1.pdf

In singular statistical models, neither the Bayes a posteriori distribution converges to the normal distribution nor the maximum likelihood estimator satisfies asymptotic normality. This is the main reason why it has been difficult to predict their generalization performances from trained states. In this paper, we study four errors, (1) Bayes generalization error, (2) Bayes training error, (3) Gibbs generalization error, and (4) Gibbs training error, and prove that there are mathematical relations among these errors. The formulas proved in this paper are equations of states in statistical estimation because they hold for any true distribution, any parametric model, and any a priori distribution.

The Scheffe tournament estimate requires fewer computations than the minimum distance estimate, but has strictly weaker guarantees than the latter.   We focus on the computational aspect of density estimation. We present two algorithms, both with the same guarantee as the minimum distance estimate. The first one, a modification of the minimum distance estimate, uses the same number (quadratic in |F|) of computations as the Scheffe tournament. The second one, called ``efficient minimum loss-weight estimate,'' uses only a linear number of computations, assuming that F is preprocessed.

However, unlike existing regularization based CF methods, our approach can be used to also incorporate information such as attributes of the users or the objects -- a limitation of existing regularization based CF methods. We then provide novel representer theorems that we use to develop new estimation methods. We provide learning algorithms based on low-rank decompositions, and test them on a standard CF dataset. The experiments indicate the advantages of generalizing the existing regularization based CF methods to incorporate related information about users and objects.

0804.4741v1,The Effect of Structural Diversity of an Ensemble of Classifiers on   Classification Accuracy,"Lesedi Masisi, Fulufhelo V. Nelwamondo, Tshilidzi Marwala","This paper aims to showcase the measure of structural diversity of an ensemble of 9 classifiers and then map a relationship between this structural diversity and accuracy. The structural diversity was induced by having different architectures or structures of the classifiers The Genetical Algorithms (GA) were used to derive the relationship between diversity and the classification accuracy by evolving the classifiers and then picking 9 classifiers out on an ensemble of 60 classifiers. It was found that as the ensemble became diverse the accuracy improved. However at a certain diversity measure the accuracy began to drop. The Kohavi-Wolpert variance method is used to measure the diversity of the ensemble. A method of voting is used to aggregate the results from each classifier. The lowest error was observed at a diversity measure of 0.16 with a mean square error of 0.274, when taking 0.2024 as maximum diversity measured. The parameters that were varied were: the number of hidden nodes, learning rate and the activation function.",ML,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0804.4741v1.pdf
0804.4898v1,A Quadratic Loss Multi-Class SVM,"Emmanuel Monfrini, Yann Guermeur","Using a support vector machine requires to set two types of hyperparameters: the soft margin parameter C and the parameters of the kernel. To perform this model selection task, the method of choice is cross-validation. Its leave-one-out variant is known to produce an estimator of the generalization error which is almost unbiased. Its major drawback rests in its time requirement. To overcome this difficulty, several upper bounds on the leave-one-out error of the pattern recognition SVM have been derived. Among those bounds, the most popular one is probably the radius-margin bound. It applies to the hard margin pattern recognition SVM, and by extension to the 2-norm SVM. In this report, we introduce a quadratic loss M-SVM, the M-SVM^2, as a direct extension of the 2-norm SVM to the multi-class case. For this machine, a generalized radius-margin bound is then established.",ML,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0804.4898v1.pdf

Tony Cai, Guangwu Xu, Jun Zhang","This article considers constrained $\ell_1$ minimization methods for the recovery of high dimensional sparse signals in three settings: noiseless, bounded error and Gaussian noise. A unified and elementary treatment is given in these noise settings for two $\ell_1$ minimization methods: the Dantzig selector and $\ell_1$ minimization with an $\ell_2$ constraint. The results of this paper improve the existing results in the literature by weakening the conditions and tightening the error bounds. The improvement on the conditions shows that signals with larger support can be recovered accurately. This paper also establishes connections between restricted isometry property and the mutual incoherence property.

The sample bias correction technique commonly used in machine learning consists of reweighting the cost of an error on each training point of a biased sample to more closely reflect the unbiased distribution. This relies on weights derived by various estimation techniques based on finite samples. We analyze the effect of an error in that estimation on the accuracy of the hypothesis returned by the learning algorithm for two estimation techniques: a cluster-based estimation technique and kernel mean matching. We also report the results of sample bias correction experiments with several data sets using these techniques. Our analysis is based on the novel concept of distributional stability which generalizes the existing concept of point-based stability. Much of our work and proof techniques can be used to analyze other importance weighting techniques and their effect on accuracy when using a distributionally stable algorithm.,ML,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0805.2775v1.pdf

The fundamental quantity of interest is the sample complexity: the number of samples required to learn to a specified level of accuracy. Here we consider learning over the set of all computable labeling functions. Since the VC-dimension is infinite and a priori (uniform) bounds on the number of samples are impossible, we let the learning algorithm decide when it has seen sufficient samples to have learned. We first show that learning in this setting is indeed possible, and develop a learning algorithm. We then show, however, that bounding sample complexity independently of the distribution is impossible. Notably, this impossibility is entirely due to the requirement that the learning algorithm be computable, and not due to the statistical nature of the problem.",ML,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0806.3537v2.pdf

In other words, there is an algorithm with the claimed running time that, given epsilon, delta > 0 and access to a random walk on {-1,+1}^n labeled by an arbitrary function f:{-1,+1}^n -> {-1,+1}, finds with probability at least 1-delta a k-junta that is (opt(f)+epsilon)-close to f, where opt(f) denotes the distance of a closest k-junta to f.",ML,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0806.4210v1.pdf

The method boils down to a statistical estimation task and various estimators have been proposed, based on the geometric mean, the harmonic mean, and the fractional power etc.   This study proposes the optimal quantile estimator, whose main operation is selecting, which is considerably less expensive than taking fractional power, the main operation in previous estimators. Our experiments report that the optimal quantile estimator is nearly one order of magnitude more computationally efficient than previous estimators. For large-scale learning tasks in which storing and computing pairwise distances is a serious bottleneck, this estimator should be desirable.   In addition to its computational advantages, the optimal quantile estimator exhibits nice theoretical properties. It is more accurate than previous estimators when $\alpha>1$.

For massive high-dimensional data, computing all pairwise distances of A can be infeasible. In fact, even storing A or all pairwise distances of A in the memory may be also infeasible. This paper proposes a simple method for p = 2, 4, 6, ... We first decompose the l_p (where p is even) distances into a sum of 2 marginal norms and p-1 ``inner products'' at different orders. Then we apply normal or sub-Gaussian random projections to approximate the resultant ``inner products,'' assuming that the marginal norms can be computed exactly by a linear scan. We propose two strategies for applying random projections. The basic projection strategy requires only one projection matrix but it is more difficult to analyze, while the alternative projection strategy requires p-1 projection matrices but its theoretical analysis is much easier. In terms of the accuracy, at least for p=4, the basic strategy is always more accurate than the alternative strategy if the data are non-negative, which is common in reality.",ML,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0806.4423v1.pdf

When the graphs are sparse, conjugate gradient solvers or fixed-point iterations bring our algorithm into the sub-cubic domain. Experiments on graphs from bioinformatics and other application domains show that it is often more than a thousand times faster than previous approaches. We then explore connections between diffusion kernels \citep{KonLaf02}, regularization on graphs \citep{SmoKon03}, and graph kernels, and use these connections to propose new graph kernels.

0807.2983v1,"On Probability Distributions for Trees: Representations, Inference and   Learning","François Denis, Amaury Habrard, Rémi Gilleron, Marc Tommasi, Édouard Gilbert","We study probability distributions over free algebras of trees. Probability distributions can be seen as particular (formal power) tree series [Berstel et al 82, Esik et al 03], i.e. mappings from trees to a semiring K . A widely studied class of tree series is the class of rational (or recognizable) tree series which can be defined either in an algebraic way or by means of multiplicity tree automata. We argue that the algebraic representation is very convenient to model probability distributions over a free algebra of trees. First, as in the string case, the algebraic representation allows to design learning algorithms for the whole class of probability distributions defined by rational tree series. Note that learning algorithms for rational tree series correspond to learning algorithms for weighted tree automata where both the structure and the weights are learned. Second, the algebraic representation can be easily extended to deal with unranked trees (like XML trees where a symbol may have an unbounded number of children). Both properties are particularly relevant for applications: nondeterministic automata are required for the inference problem to be relevant (recall that Hidden Markov Models are equivalent to nondeterministic string automata); nowadays applications for Web Information Extraction, Web Services and document processing consider unranked trees.",ML,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0807.2983v1.pdf
0807.4198v2,Positive factor networks: A graphical framework for modeling   non-negative sequential data,Brian K. Vogel,"We present a novel graphical framework for modeling non-negative sequential data with hierarchical structure. Our model corresponds to a network of coupled non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) modules, which we refer to as a positive factor network (PFN). The data model is linear, subject to non-negativity constraints, so that observation data consisting of an additive combination of individually representable observations is also representable by the network. This is a desirable property for modeling problems in computational auditory scene analysis, since distinct sound sources in the environment are often well-modeled as combining additively in the corresponding magnitude spectrogram. We propose inference and learning algorithms that leverage existing NMF algorithms and that are straightforward to implement. We present a target tracking example and provide results for synthetic observation data which serve to illustrate the interesting properties of PFNs and motivate their potential usefulness in applications such as music transcription, source separation, and speech recognition. We show how a target process characterized by a hierarchical state transition model can be represented as a PFN. Our results illustrate that a PFN which is defined in terms of a single target observation can then be used to effectively track the states of multiple simultaneous targets. Our results show that the quality of the inferred target states degrades gradually as the observation noise is increased. We also present results for an example in which meaningful hierarchical features are extracted from a spectrogram. Such a hierarchical representation could be useful for music transcription and source separation applications. We also propose a network for language modeling.",ML,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0807.4198v2.pdf

It is well known that if the regularizer is a nondecreasing function of the inner product then the learned vector is a linear combination of the input data. This result, known as the {\em representer theorem}, is at the basis of kernel-based methods in machine learning. In this paper, we prove the necessity of the above condition, thereby completing the characterization of kernel methods based on regularization. We further extend our analysis to regularization methods which learn a matrix, a problem which is motivated by the application to multi-task learning. In this context, we study a more general representer theorem, which holds for a larger class of regularizers. We provide a necessary and sufficient condition for these class of matrix regularizers and highlight them with some concrete examples of practical importance.

In the context of learning linear functions for supervised classification or regression, this can be achieved by including a priori information about the weight vectors associated with the tasks, and how they are expected to be related to each other. In this paper, we assume that tasks are clustered into groups, which are unknown beforehand, and that tasks within a group have similar weight vectors. We design a new spectral norm that encodes this a priori assumption, without the prior knowledge of the partition of tasks into groups, resulting in a new convex optimization formulation for multi-task learning. We show in simulations on synthetic examples and on the IEDB MHC-I binding dataset, that our approach outperforms well-known convex methods for multi-task learning, as well as related non convex methods dedicated to the same problem.",ML,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0809.2085v1.pdf

We call this method the Isometric Separation Map and we show that the resulting kernel matrix can be used as a binary/multiclass Support Vector Machine-like method in a semi-supervised (transductive) framework. We also show that the method always finds a kernel matrix that linearly separates the training data exactly without projecting them in infinite dimensional spaces. In traditional SVMs we choose a kernel and hope that the data become linearly separable in the kernel space.

0811.0139v1,"Entropy, Perception, and Relativity",Stefan Jaeger,"In this paper, I expand Shannon's definition of entropy into a new form of entropy that allows integration of information from different random events. Shannon's notion of entropy is a special case of my more general definition of entropy. I define probability using a so-called performance function, which is de facto an exponential distribution. Assuming that my general notion of entropy reflects the true uncertainty about a probabilistic event, I understand that our perceived uncertainty differs. I claim that our perception is the result of two opposing forces similar to the two famous antagonists in Chinese philosophy: Yin and Yang. Based on this idea, I show that our perceived uncertainty matches the true uncertainty in points determined by the golden ratio. I demonstrate that the well-known sigmoid function, which we typically employ in artificial neural networks as a non-linear threshold function, describes the actual performance. Furthermore, I provide a motivation for the time dilation in Einstein's Special Relativity, basically claiming that although time dilation conforms with our perception, it does not correspond to reality. At the end of the paper, I show how to apply this theoretical framework to practical applications. I present recognition rates for a pattern recognition problem, and also propose a network architecture that can take advantage of general entropy to solve complex decision problems.",ML,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0811.0139v1.pdf
0811.1629v1,Stability Bound for Stationary Phi-mixing and Beta-mixing Processes,"Mehryar Mohri, Afshin Rostamizadeh","Most generalization bounds in learning theory are based on some measure of the complexity of the hypothesis class used, independently of any algorithm. In contrast, the notion of algorithmic stability can be used to derive tight generalization bounds that are tailored to specific learning algorithms by exploiting their particular properties. However, as in much of learning theory, existing stability analyses and bounds apply only in the scenario where the samples are independently and identically distributed. In many machine learning applications, however, this assumption does not hold. The observations received by the learning algorithm often have some inherent temporal dependence.   This paper studies the scenario where the observations are drawn from a stationary phi-mixing or beta-mixing sequence, a widely adopted assumption in the study of non-i.i.d. processes that implies a dependence between observations weakening over time. We prove novel and distinct stability-based generalization bounds for stationary phi-mixing and beta-mixing sequences. These bounds strictly generalize the bounds given in the i.i.d. case and apply to all stable learning algorithms, thereby extending the use of stability-bounds to non-i.i.d. scenarios.   We also illustrate the application of our phi-mixing generalization bounds to general classes of learning algorithms, including Support Vector Regression, Kernel Ridge Regression, and Support Vector Machines, and many other kernel regularization-based and relative entropy-based regularization algorithms. These novel bounds can thus be viewed as the first theoretical basis for the use of these algorithms in non-i.i.d. scenarios.",ML,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0811.1629v1.pdf

Intuitively, an ensemble system should consist of base classifiers which are diverse i.e. classifiers whose decision boundaries err differently. In this paper ensemble feature selection is used to impose diversity in ensembles. The features of the constituent base classifiers for each ensemble were created through an exhaustive search algorithm using different separability indices. For each ensemble, the classification accuracy was derived as well as a diversity measure purported to give a measure of the inensemble diversity. The correlation between ensemble classification accuracy and diversity measure was determined to establish the interplay between the two variables. From the findings of this paper, diversity measures as currently formulated do not provide an adequate means upon which to constitute ensembles for land cover mapping.",ML,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0811.2016v1.pdf

When the set of arms corresponds to the unit sphere, we prove that the regret and Bayes risk is of order $\Theta(r \sqrt{T})$, by establishing a lower bound for an arbitrary policy, and showing that a matching upper bound is obtained through a policy that alternates between exploration and exploitation phases. The phase-based policy is also shown to be effective if the set of arms satisfies a strong convexity condition.

Distributed connection preemption is an important example where nodes can make intelligent decisions on allocating resources and controlling traffic flows for multi-class service networks. A challenge is that nodal decisions are spatially dependent as traffic flows trespass multiple nodes in a network. Hence the performance-complexity trade-off becomes important, i.e., how accurate decisions are versus how much information is exchanged among nodes. Connection preemption is known to be NP-complete. Centralized preemption is optimal but computationally intractable. Decentralized preemption is computationally efficient but may result in a poor performance. This work investigates distributed preemption where nodes decide whether and which flows to preempt using only local information exchange with neighbors. We develop, based on the probabilistic graphical models, a near-optimal distributed algorithm. The algorithm is used by each node to make collectively near-optimal preemption decisions. We study trade-offs between near-optimal performance and complexity that corresponds to the amount of information-exchange of the distributed algorithm. The algorithm is validated by both analysis and simulation.",ML,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0901.0753v1.pdf

For example, experiments in genome biology usually provide databases with thousands of attributes (genes) but only tens of objects (experiments). In this case, mining the ""transposed"" database runs through a smaller search space, and the Galois connection allows to infer the closed patterns of the original database. We focus here on constrained pattern mining for those unusual databases and give a theoretical framework for database and constraint transposition. We discuss the properties of constraint transposition and look into classical constraints. We then address the problem of generating the closed patterns of the original database satisfying the constraint, starting from those mined in the ""transposed"" database.

A related problem from both the mathematical and algorithmic point of view is the distance geometry problem of realizing points in a Euclidean space from a given subset of their pairwise distances. Rigidity theory answers basic questions regarding the uniqueness of the realization satisfying a given partial set of distances. We observe that basic ideas and tools of rigidity theory can be adapted to determine uniqueness of low-rank matrix completion, where inner products play the role that distances play in rigidity theory. This observation leads to an efficient randomized algorithm for testing both local and global unique completion. Crucial to our analysis is a new matrix, which we call the completion matrix, that serves as the analogue of the rigidity matrix.",ML,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0902.3846v1.pdf
0902.4127v2,Prediction with expert evaluators' advice,"Alexey Chernov, Vladimir Vovk","We introduce a new protocol for prediction with expert advice in which each expert evaluates the learner's and his own performance using a loss function that may change over time and may be different from the loss functions used by the other experts. The learner's goal is to perform better or not much worse than each expert, as evaluated by that expert, for all experts simultaneously. If the loss functions used by the experts are all proper scoring rules and all mixable, we show that the defensive forecasting algorithm enjoys the same performance guarantee as that attainable by the Aggregating Algorithm in the standard setting and known to be optimal. This result is also applied to the case of ""specialist"" (or ""sleeping"") experts. In this case, the defensive forecasting algorithm reduces to a simple modification of the Aggregating Algorithm.",ML,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0902.4127v2.pdf

0903.1125v1,Efficient Human Computation,"Ran Gilad-Bachrach, Aharon Bar-Hillel, Liat Ein-Dor","Collecting large labeled data sets is a laborious and expensive task, whose scaling up requires division of the labeling workload between many teachers. When the number of classes is large, miscorrespondences between the labels given by the different teachers are likely to occur, which, in the extreme case, may reach total inconsistency. In this paper we describe how globally consistent labels can be obtained, despite the absence of teacher coordination, and discuss the possible efficiency of this process in terms of human labor. We define a notion of label efficiency, measuring the ratio between the number of globally consistent labels obtained and the number of labels provided by distributed teachers. We show that the efficiency depends critically on the ratio alpha between the number of data instances seen by a single teacher, and the number of classes. We suggest several algorithms for the distributed labeling problem, and analyze their efficiency as a function of alpha. In addition, we provide an upper bound on label efficiency for the case of completely uncoordinated teachers, and show that efficiency approaches 0 as the ratio between the number of labels each teacher provides and the number of classes drops (i.e. alpha goes to 0).",ML,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0903.1125v1.pdf

0904.2160v1,Inferring Dynamic Bayesian Networks using Frequent Episode Mining,"Debprakash Patnaik, Srivatsan Laxman, Naren Ramakrishnan","Motivation: Several different threads of research have been proposed for modeling and mining temporal data. On the one hand, approaches such as dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs) provide a formal probabilistic basis to model relationships between time-indexed random variables but these models are intractable to learn in the general case. On the other, algorithms such as frequent episode mining are scalable to large datasets but do not exhibit the rigorous probabilistic interpretations that are the mainstay of the graphical models literature.   Results: We present a unification of these two seemingly diverse threads of research, by demonstrating how dynamic (discrete) Bayesian networks can be inferred from the results of frequent episode mining. This helps bridge the modeling emphasis of the former with the counting emphasis of the latter. First, we show how, under reasonable assumptions on data characteristics and on influences of random variables, the optimal DBN structure can be computed using a greedy, local, algorithm. Next, we connect the optimality of the DBN structure with the notion of fixed-delay episodes and their counts of distinct occurrences. Finally, to demonstrate the practical feasibility of our approach, we focus on a specific (but broadly applicable) class of networks, called excitatory networks, and show how the search for the optimal DBN structure can be conducted using just information from frequent episodes. Application on datasets gathered from mathematical models of spiking neurons as well as real neuroscience datasets are presented.

In this setting, it is a known result that a state of prior ignorance is not compatible with learning. To overcome this problem, another state of beliefs, called \emph{near-ignorance}, has been proposed. Near-ignorance resembles ignorance very closely, by satisfying some principles that can arguably be regarded as necessary in a state of ignorance, and allows learning to take place. What this paper does, is to provide new and substantial evidence that also near-ignorance cannot be really regarded as a way out of the problem of starting statistical inference in conditions of very weak beliefs. The key to this result is focusing on a setting characterized by a variable of interest that is \emph{latent}. We argue that such a setting is by far the most common case in practice, and we provide, for the case of categorical latent variables (and general \emph{manifest} variables) a condition that, if satisfied, prevents learning to take place under prior near-ignorance. This condition is shown to be easily satisfied even in the most common statistical problems. We regard these results as a strong form of evidence against the possibility to adopt a condition of prior near-ignorance in real statistical problems.",ML,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0904.4527v1.pdf

We describe an application of temporal data mining for analyzing fault logs in an engine assembly plant. Frequent episode discovery framework is a model-free method that can be used to deduce (temporal) correlations among events from the logs in an efficient manner. In addition to being theoretically elegant and computationally efficient, frequent episodes are also easy to interpret in the form actionable recommendations. Incorporation of domain-specific information is critical to successful application of the method for analyzing fault logs in the manufacturing domain. We show how domain-specific knowledge can be incorporated using heuristic rules that act as pre-filters and post-filters to frequent episode discovery. The system described here is currently being used in one of the engine assembly plants of General Motors and is planned for adaptation in other plants. To the best of our knowledge, this paper presents the first real, large-scale application of temporal data mining in the manufacturing domain.

0905.4022v1,Transfer Learning Using Feature Selection,"Paramveer S. Dhillon, Dean Foster, Lyle Ungar","We present three related ways of using Transfer Learning to improve feature selection. The three methods address different problems, and hence share different kinds of information between tasks or feature classes, but all three are based on the information theoretic Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle and share the same underlying Bayesian interpretation. The first method, MIC, applies when predictive models are to be built simultaneously for multiple tasks (``simultaneous transfer'') that share the same set of features. MIC allows each feature to be added to none, some, or all of the task models and is most beneficial for selecting a small set of predictive features from a large pool of features, as is common in genomic and biological datasets. Our second method, TPC (Three Part Coding), uses a similar methodology for the case when the features can be divided into feature classes. Our third method, Transfer-TPC, addresses the ``sequential transfer'' problem in which the task to which we want to transfer knowledge may not be known in advance and may have different amounts of data than the other tasks. Transfer-TPC is most beneficial when we want to transfer knowledge between tasks which have unequal amounts of labeled data, for example the data for disambiguating the senses of different verbs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these approaches with experimental results on real world data pertaining to genomics and to Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD).",ML,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0905.4022v1.pdf

To overcome these problems, in the previous papers, we proved new equations in statistical learning, by which we can estimate the Bayes generalization loss from the Bayes training loss and the functional variance, on the condition that the true distribution is a singularity contained in a learning machine. In this paper, we prove that the same equations hold even if a true distribution is not contained in a parametric model. Also we prove that, the proposed equations in a regular case are asymptotically equivalent to the Takeuchi information criterion. Therefore, the proposed equations are always applicable without any condition on the unknown true distribution.",ML,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0906.0211v2.pdf

Improved understanding of these clusters is of utmost importance, since they have been shown to be the source of evolutionary innovation, and have been linked to multiple diseases, including HIV and a variety of cancers. Previously, Zhang et al. (2008) developed an algorithm for reconstructing parsimonious evolutionary histories of such gene clusters, using only human genomic sequence data. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic model for the evolution of gene clusters on a phylogeny, and an MCMC algorithm for reconstruction of duplication histories from genomic sequences in multiple species. Several projects are underway to obtain high quality BAC-based assemblies of duplicated clusters in multiple species, and we anticipate that our method will be useful in analyzing these valuable new data sets.",ML,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0906.2635v1.pdf

Recently, researchers and technology companies have attempted to extend the capabilities of large language models into languages other than English by building what are called multilingual language models.   In this paper, we explain how these multilingual language models work and explore their capabilities and limits. Part I provides a simple technical explanation of how large language models work, why there is a gap in available data between English and other languages, and how multilingual language models attempt to bridge that gap.

We present a preliminary analysis of commercial large language models on two tasks (machine translation and text classification) across eight African languages, spanning different language families and geographical areas.

Bergen","For many low-resource languages, the only available language models are large multilingual models trained on many languages simultaneously. However, using FLORES perplexity as a metric, we find that these models perform worse than bigrams for many languages (e.g. 24% of languages in XGLM 4.5B; 43% in BLOOM 7.1B). To facilitate research that focuses on low-resource languages, we pre-train and release Goldfish, a suite of monolingual autoregressive Transformer language models up to 125M parameters for 350 languages. The Goldfish reach lower FLORES perplexities than BLOOM, XGLM, and MaLA-500 on 98 of 204 FLORES languages, despite each Goldfish model being over 10x smaller. However, the Goldfish significantly underperform larger multilingual models on reasoning benchmarks, suggesting that for low-resource languages, multilinguality primarily improves general reasoning abilities rather than basic text generation. We release models trained on 5MB (350 languages), 10MB (288 languages), 100MB (166 languages), and 1GB (83 languages) of text data where available.

In this paper, we propose a method for medical image registration using a pretrained large language model. We find that using the pretrained large language model to encode deep features of the medical images in the registration model can effectively improve image registration accuracy, indicating the great potential of the large language model in medical image registration tasks. We use dual encoders to perform deep feature extraction on image pairs and then input the features into the pretrained large language model. To adapt the large language model to our registration task, the weights of the large language model are frozen in the registration model, and an adapter is utilized to fine-tune the large language model, which aims at (a) mapping the visual tokens to the language space before the large language model computing, (b) project the modeled language tokens output from the large language model to the visual space. Our method combines output features from the fine-tuned large language model with the features output from each encoder layer to gradually generate the deformation fields required for registration in the decoder. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the large prediction model in registration tasks, we conducted experiments on knee and brain MRI and achieved state-of-the-art results.",LLM,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.18774v1.pdf

There is consequently a strong trend towards building native language models even for low-resource languages. This paper questions this development, and explores the idea of simply translating the data into English, thereby enabling the use of pretrained, and large-scale, English language models. We demonstrate empirically that a large English language model coupled with modern machine translation outperforms native language models in most Scandinavian languages. The exception to this is Finnish, which we assume is due to inferior translation quality. Our results suggest that machine translation is a mature technology, which raises a serious counter-argument for training native language models for low-resource languages. This paper therefore strives to make a provocative but important point. As English language models are improving at an unprecedented pace, which in turn improves machine translation, it is from an empirical and environmental stand-point more effective to translate data from low-resource languages into English, than to build language models for such languages.",LLM,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.10441v1.pdf

Similar to some recent related work, we make visual information accessible to the language model using separate verbalisation models. Specifically, we investigate the performance of open-source, open-access language models against GPT-3 on five vision-language tasks when given textually-encoded visual information. Our results suggest that language models are effective for solving vision-language tasks even with limited samples.

Still, it remains unclear how this approach should be applied for unseen languages that are not covered by any available large-scale multilingual language model and for which only a small amount of raw data is generally available. In this work, by comparing multilingual and monolingual models, we show that such models behave in multiple ways on unseen languages. Some languages greatly benefit from transfer learning and behave similarly to closely related high resource languages whereas others apparently do not. Focusing on the latter, we show that this failure to transfer is largely related to the impact of the script used to write such languages.

Although numerous model compression techniques have been investigated, they typically rely on a calibration set that overlooks the multilingual context and results in significant accuracy degradation for low-resource languages. This paper introduces Multilingual Brain Surgeon (MBS), a novel calibration data sampling method for multilingual LLMs compression. MBS overcomes the English-centric limitations of existing methods by sampling calibration data from various languages proportionally to the language distribution of the model training datasets. Our experiments, conducted on the BLOOM multilingual LLM, demonstrate that MBS improves the performance of existing English-centric compression methods, especially for low-resource languages. We also uncover the dynamics of language interaction during compression, revealing that the larger the proportion of a language in the training set and the more similar the language is to the calibration language, the better performance the language retains after compression. In conclusion, MBS presents an innovative approach to compressing multilingual LLMs, addressing the performance disparities and improving the language inclusivity of existing compression techniques.",LLM,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.04748v1.pdf

We implement a framework that includes three main components: (1) introducing relation tuples into the reasoning steps of large language models; (2) implementing an automatic verification process of reasoning steps with a local code interpreter based on relation tuples; and (3) integrating a simple and effective dynamic feedback mechanism, which we found helpful for self-improvement of large language models. The experimental results on various arithmetic datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in improving the arithmetic reasoning ability of large language models.

2112.07055v2,Large Language Models are not Models of Natural Language: they are   Corpus Models,Csaba Veres,"Natural Language Processing (NLP) has become one of the leading application areas in the current Artificial Intelligence boom. Transfer learning has enabled large deep learning neural networks trained on the language modeling task to vastly improve performance in almost all downstream language tasks. Interestingly, when the language models are trained with data that includes software code, they demonstrate remarkable abilities in generating functioning computer code from natural language specifications. We argue that this creates a conundrum for the claim that eliminative neural models are a radical restructuring in our understanding of cognition in that they eliminate the need for symbolic abstractions like generative phrase structure grammars. Because the syntax of programming languages is by design determined by phrase structure grammars, neural models that produce syntactic code are apparently uninformative about the theoretical foundations of programming languages. The demonstration that neural models perform well on tasks that involve clearly symbolic systems, proves that they cannot be used as an argument that language and other cognitive systems are not symbolic. Finally, we argue as a corollary that the term language model is misleading and propose the adoption of the working term corpus model instead, which better reflects the genesis and contents of the model.",LLM,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.07055v2.pdf
1909.04879v1,Dynamic Fusion: Attentional Language Model for Neural Machine   Translation,"Michiki Kurosawa, Mamoru Komachi","Neural Machine Translation (NMT) can be used to generate fluent output. As such, language models have been investigated for incorporation with NMT. In prior investigations, two models have been used: a translation model and a language model. The translation model's predictions are weighted by the language model with a hand-crafted ratio in advance. However, these approaches fail to adopt the language model weighting with regard to the translation history. In another line of approach, language model prediction is incorporated into the translation model by jointly considering source and target information. However, this line of approach is limited because it largely ignores the adequacy of the translation output.   Accordingly, this work employs two mechanisms, the translation model and the language model, with an attentive architecture to the language model as an auxiliary element of the translation model. Compared with previous work in English--Japanese machine translation using a language model, the experimental results obtained with the proposed Dynamic Fusion mechanism improve BLEU and Rank-based Intuitive Bilingual Evaluation Scores (RIBES) scores. Additionally, in the analyses of the attention and predictivity of the language model, the Dynamic Fusion mechanism allows predictive language modeling that conforms to the appropriate grammatical structure.",LLM,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.04879v1.pdf

However, many LLMs especially the open-sourced ones, such as BLOOM and LLaMA, are English-dominant and support only dozens of natural languages, making the potential of LLMs on language translation less explored. In this work, we present BigTranslate which adapts LLaMA that covers only 20 languages and enhances it with multilingual translation capability on more than 100 languages. BigTranslate is built upon LLaMA-13B and it is optimized in three steps. First, we continue training LLaMA with massive Chinese monolingual data. Second, we continue training the model with a large-scale parallel dataset that covers 102 natural languages. Third, we instruct-tune the foundation model with multilingual translation instructions, leading to our BigTranslate model. The preliminary experiments on multilingual translation show that BigTranslate performs comparably with ChatGPT and Google Translate in many languages and even outperforms ChatGPT in 8 language pairs.

However, they often struggle to recognize low-resource languages, in particular African languages, which are not well represented in large training corpora. In this paper, we consider how to adapt LLMs to low-resource African languages. We find that combining curated data from African languages with high-quality English educational texts results in a training mix that substantially improves the model's performance on these languages. On the challenging IrokoBench dataset, our models consistently achieve the best performance amongst similarly sized baselines, particularly on knowledge-intensive multiple-choice questions (AfriMMLU). Additionally, on the cross-lingual question answering benchmark AfriQA, our models outperform the base model by over 10%. To better understand the role of English data during training, we translate a subset of 200M tokens into Swahili language and perform an analysis which reveals that the content of these data is primarily responsible for the strong performance. We release our models and data to encourage future research on African languages.",LLM,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.06536v1.pdf

However, previous research mainly considered calibrating based on English text, despite the multilingual nature of modern LLMs and their frequent use in non-English languages. In this paper, we set out to investigate calibrating the pruning of multilingual language models for monolingual applications. We present the first comprehensive empirical study, comparing different calibration languages for pruning multilingual models across diverse languages, tasks, models, and SotA pruning techniques. Our results offer practical suggestions, for example, calibrating in the target language can efficiently retain the language modeling capability but does not necessarily benefit downstream tasks. Through further analysis of latent subspaces, pruning masks, and individual neurons within pruned models, we find that while pruning generally preserves strong language-specific features, it may fail to retain language-specific neuron activation patterns and subtle, language-agnostic features associated with knowledge and reasoning that are needed for complex tasks.",LLM,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.14398v3.pdf

The use of large language models as effective tools in various natural language processing tasks typically requires extensive textual data and robust hardware resources. Consequently, the scarcity of Persian textual data and the unavailability of powerful hardware resources have hindered the development of large language models for Persian. This paper introduces the first large Persian language model, named PersianLLaMA, trained on a collection of Persian texts and datasets. This foundational model comes in two versions, with 7 and 13 billion parameters, trained on formal and colloquial Persian texts using two different approaches. PersianLLaMA has been evaluated for natural language generation tasks based on the latest evaluation methods, namely using larger language models, and for natural language understanding tasks based on automated machine metrics. The results indicate that PersianLLaMA significantly outperforms its competitors in both understanding and generating Persian text. PersianLLaMA marks an important step in the development of Persian natural language processing and can be a valuable resource for the Persian-speaking community.

However, the significant memory and computational costs incurred during the inference process make it challenging to deploy large models on resource-constrained devices. In this paper, we investigate compression and efficient inference methods for large language models from an algorithmic perspective. Regarding taxonomy, similar to smaller models, compression and acceleration algorithms for large language models can still be categorized into quantization, pruning, distillation, compact architecture design, dynamic networks. However, Large language models have two prominent characteristics compared to smaller models: (1) Most of compression algorithms require finetuning or even retraining the model after compression. The most notable aspect of large models is the very high cost associated with model finetuning or training. Therefore, many algorithms for large models, such as quantization and pruning, start to explore tuning-free algorithms. (2) Large models emphasize versatility and generalization rather than performance on a single task. Hence, many algorithms, such as knowledge distillation, focus on how to preserving their versatility and generalization after compression. Since these two characteristics were not very pronounced in early large models, we further distinguish large language models into medium models and ``real'' large models. Additionally, we also provide an introduction to some mature frameworks for efficient inference of large models, which can support basic compression or acceleration algorithms, greatly facilitating model deployment for users.",LLM,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.09748v1.pdf

Our design freezes the original LLM parameters, thus safeguarding its performance in high-resource languages, while an appended MoE module, trained on diverse language datasets, augments low-resource language proficiency. Our approach significantly outperforms conventional CT methods, as evidenced by our experiments, which show marked improvements in multilingual benchmarks without sacrificing the model's original language performance. Moreover, our MoE-CT framework demonstrates enhanced resistance to forgetting and superior transfer learning capabilities.

There has been an increased interest in multi-modal language models leveraging audio and/or visual information and text. However, current multi-modal language models require both text and audio/visual data streams during inference/test time. In this work, we propose a methodology for training language models leveraging spoken language audio data but without requiring the audio stream during prediction time. This leads to an improved language model for analyzing spoken transcripts while avoiding an audio processing overhead at test time. We achieve this via an audio-language knowledge distillation framework, where we transfer acoustic and paralinguistic information from a pre-trained speech embedding (OpenAI Whisper) teacher model to help train a student language model on an audio-text dataset. In our experiments, the student model achieves consistent improvement over traditional language models on tasks analyzing spoken transcripts.",LLM,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.07014v1.pdf
2404.19159v1,What Drives Performance in Multilingual Language Models?,"Sina Bagheri Nezhad, Ameeta Agrawal","This study investigates the factors influencing the performance of multilingual large language models (MLLMs) across diverse languages. We study 6 MLLMs, including masked language models, autoregressive models, and instruction-tuned LLMs, on the SIB-200 dataset, a topic classification dataset encompassing 204 languages. Our analysis considers three scenarios: ALL languages, SEEN languages (present in the model's pretraining data), and UNSEEN languages (not present or documented in the model's pretraining data in any meaningful way). We examine the impact of factors such as pretraining data size, general resource availability, language family, and script type on model performance. Decision tree analysis reveals that pretraining data size is the most influential factor for SEEN languages. However, interestingly, script type and language family are crucial for UNSEEN languages, highlighting the importance of cross-lingual transfer learning. Notably, model size and architecture do not significantly alter the most important features identified. Our findings provide valuable insights into the strengths and limitations of current MLLMs and hope to guide the development of more effective and equitable multilingual NLP systems.",LLM,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.19159v1.pdf
2308.13782v2,Planning with Logical Graph-based Language Model for Instruction   Generation,"Fan Zhang, Kebing Jin, Hankz Hankui Zhuo","Despite the superior performance of large language models to generate natural language texts, it is hard to generate texts with correct logic according to a given task, due to the difficulties for neural models to capture implied rules from free-form texts. In this paper, we propose a novel graph-based language model, Logical-GLM, to infuse logic into language models for more valid text generation and interpretability. Specifically, we first capture information from natural language instructions and construct logical bayes graphs that generally describe domains. Next, we generate logical skeletons to guide language model training, infusing domain knowledge into language models. Finally, we alternately optimize the searching policy of graphs and language models until convergence. The experimental results show that Logical-GLM is both effective and efficient compared with traditional language models, despite using smaller-scale training data and fewer parameters. Our approach can generate instructional texts with more correct logic owing to the internalized domain knowledge. Moreover, the usage of logical graphs reflects the inner mechanism of the language models, which improves the interpretability of black-box models.",LLM,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.13782v2.pdf
2101.06949v1,HinFlair: pre-trained contextual string embeddings for pos tagging and   text classification in the Hindi language,Harsh Patel,"Recent advancements in language models based on recurrent neural networks and transformers architecture have achieved state-of-the-art results on a wide range of natural language processing tasks such as pos tagging, named entity recognition, and text classification. However, most of these language models are pre-trained in high resource languages like English, German, Spanish. Multi-lingual language models include Indian languages like Hindi, Telugu, Bengali in their training corpus, but they often fail to represent the linguistic features of these languages as they are not the primary language of the study. We introduce HinFlair, which is a language representation model (contextual string embeddings) pre-trained on a large monolingual Hindi corpus. Experiments were conducted on 6 text classification datasets and a Hindi dependency treebank to analyze the performance of these contextualized string embeddings for the Hindi language. Results show that HinFlair outperforms previous state-of-the-art publicly available pre-trained embeddings for downstream tasks like text classification and pos tagging. Also, HinFlair when combined with FastText embeddings outperforms many transformers-based language models trained particularly for the Hindi language.",LLM,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.06949v1.pdf

A Case   Study on BLOOM,"Shaoxiong Ji, Pinzhen Chen","Instruction tuning a large language model with multiple languages can prepare it for multilingual downstream tasks. Nonetheless, it is yet to be determined whether having a handful of languages is sufficient, or whether the benefits increase with the inclusion of more. By fine-tuning large multilingual models on 1 to 52 languages, we present a case study on BLOOM to understand three pertinent factors affecting performance: the number of languages, language exposure, and similarity between training and test languages. Overall we found that 1) expanding language coverage in multilingual instruction tuning proves to be beneficial; 2) accuracy often significantly boots if the test language appears in the instruction mixture; 3) languages' genetic features correlate with cross-lingual transfer more than merely the number of language but different languages benefit to various degrees.",LLM,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.04850v2.pdf

Such language models are semi-parametric, where models integrate model parameters and knowledge from external data sources to make their predictions, as opposed to the parametric nature of vanilla large language models.

For N-gram models, this study shows that effective data size selection remains crucial for establishing effective frequency distributions of the target languages, that efficiently model each language, thus, improving language ranking. For pre-trained multilingual models, we conduct extensive experiments covering a diverse set of massively pre-trained multilingual (PLM) models -- mBERT, RemBERT, XLM-r, and Afri-centric multilingual models -- AfriBERTa, Afro-XLMr, AfroLM, and Serengeti. We further compare these models with available large-scale Language Identification tools: Compact Language Detector v3 (CLD V3), AfroLID, GlotLID, and OpenLID to highlight the importance of focused-based LID. From these, we show that Serengeti is a superior model across models: N-grams to Transformers on average. Moreover, we propose a lightweight BERT-based LID model (za_BERT_lid) trained with NHCLT + Vukzenzele corpus, which performs on par with our best-performing Afri-centric models.",LLM,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.08728v1.pdf
2311.09194v1,Structural Priming Demonstrates Abstract Grammatical Representations in   Multilingual Language Models,"James A. Michaelov, Catherine Arnett, Tyler A. Chang, Benjamin K. Bergen","Abstract grammatical knowledge - of parts of speech and grammatical patterns - is key to the capacity for linguistic generalization in humans. But how abstract is grammatical knowledge in large language models? In the human literature, compelling evidence for grammatical abstraction comes from structural priming. A sentence that shares the same grammatical structure as a preceding sentence is processed and produced more readily. Because confounds exist when using stimuli in a single language, evidence of abstraction is even more compelling from crosslingual structural priming, where use of a syntactic structure in one language primes an analogous structure in another language. We measure crosslingual structural priming in large language models, comparing model behavior to human experimental results from eight crosslingual experiments covering six languages, and four monolingual structural priming experiments in three non-English languages. We find evidence for abstract monolingual and crosslingual grammatical representations in the models that function similarly to those found in humans. These results demonstrate that grammatical representations in multilingual language models are not only similar across languages, but they can causally influence text produced in different languages.",LLM,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.09194v1.pdf

Large generative models can be used for code generation and code completion, while smaller encoder-only models are capable of performing code search tasks using natural language queries.These capabilities are heavily influenced by the quality and diversity of the available training data. Source code datasets used for training usually focus on the most popular languages and testing is mostly conducted on the same distributions, often overlooking low-resource programming languages. Motivated by the NLP generalization taxonomy proposed by Hupkes et.\,al., we propose a new benchmark dataset called GenCodeSearchNet (GeCS) which builds upon existing natural language code search datasets to systemically evaluate the programming language understanding generalization capabilities of language models. As part of the full dataset, we introduce a new, manually curated subset StatCodeSearch that focuses on R, a popular but so far underrepresented programming language that is often used by researchers outside the field of computer science. For evaluation and comparison, we collect several baseline results using fine-tuned BERT-style models and GPT-style large language models in a zero-shot setting.",LLM,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.09707v1.pdf

Our language development is largely shaped by our social interactions, for example, the demonstration and feedback from caregivers. Contrary to human language learning, recent advancements in large language models have primarily adopted a non-interactive training paradigm, and refined pre-trained models through feedback afterward. In this work, we aim to examine how corrective feedback from interactions influences neural language acquisition from the ground up through systematically controlled experiments, assessing whether it contributes to learning efficiency in language models. We introduce a trial-and-demonstration (TnD) learning framework that incorporates three components: student trials, teacher demonstrations, and a reward conditioned on language competence at various developmental stages. Our experiments reveal that the TnD approach accelerates word acquisition for student models of equal and smaller numbers of parameters, and we highlight the significance of both trials and demonstrations. We further show that the teacher's choices of words influence students' word-specific learning efficiency, and a practice-makes-perfect effect is evident by a strong correlation between the frequency of words in trials and their respective learning curves. Our findings suggest that interactive language learning, with teacher demonstrations and student trials, can facilitate efficient word learning in language models.",LLM,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.13828v1.pdf

On the other hand, across various applications, an outstanding question involves the capacity of large language models to comprehend expressions of human mental health conditions in natural language. This study presents an initial evaluation of large language models in addressing this gap.

As with other software engineering artifacts, software models are subject to evolution. Supporting modelers in evolving models by model completion facilities and providing high-level edit operations such as frequently occurring editing patterns is still an open problem. Recently, large language models (i.e., generative neural networks) have garnered significant attention in various research areas, including software engineering. In this paper, we explore the potential of large language models in supporting the evolution of software models in software engineering. We propose an approach that utilizes large language models for model completion and discovering editing patterns in model histories of software systems. Through controlled experiments using simulated model repositories, we conduct an evaluation of the potential of large language models for these two tasks.

Audio language models are mostly initialized from pre-trained audio encoders and large language models (LLMs). Although these pre-trained components were developed to support multiple languages, audio-language models are trained predominantly on English data, which may limit their usability to only English instructions or English speech inputs. First, this paper examines the performance of existing audio language models in an underserved language using Thai as an example. This paper demonstrates that, despite being built on multilingual backbones, audio language models do not exhibit cross-lingual emergent abilities to low-resource languages. Second, this paper studies data mixture for developing audio language models that are optimized for a target language as well as English. In addition. this paper integrates audio comprehension and speech instruction-following capabilities into a single unified model. Our experiments provide insights into data mixture for enhancing instruction-following capabilities in both a low-resource language and English.

In an attempt to address this limitation in the modeling power of transformer-based language models, we propose augmenting them with a differentiable, stack-based attention mechanism. Our stack-based attention mechanism can be incorporated into any transformer-based language model and adds a level of interpretability to the model.

2312.14504v2,Theory of Hallucinations based on Equivariance,Hisaichi Shibata,"This study aims to acquire knowledge for creating very large language models that are immune to hallucinations. Hallucinations in contemporary large language models are often attributed to a misunderstanding of real-world social relationships. Therefore, I hypothesize that very large language models capable of thoroughly grasping all these relationships will be free from hallucinations. Additionally, I propose that certain types of equivariant language models are adept at learning and understanding these relationships. Building on this, I have developed a specialized cross-entropy error function to create a hallucination scale for language models, which measures their extent of equivariance acquisition. Utilizing this scale, I tested language models for their ability to acquire character-level equivariance. In particular, I introduce and employ a novel technique based on T5 (Text To Text Transfer Transformer) that efficiently understands permuted input texts without the need for explicit dictionaries to convert token IDs (integers) to texts (strings). This T5 model demonstrated a moderate ability to acquire character-level equivariance. Additionally, I discovered scale laws that can aid in developing hallucination-free language models at the character level. This methodology can be extended to assess equivariance acquisition at the word level, paving the way for very large language models that can comprehensively understand relationships and, consequently, avoid hallucinations.",LLM,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.14504v2.pdf

However, research on the intrinsic performance of language models on African languages has been extremely limited, which is made more challenging by the lack of large or standardised training and evaluation sets that exist for English and other high-resource languages. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of open-vocabulary language models on low-resource South African languages, using byte-pair encoding to handle the rich morphology of these languages. We evaluate different variants of n-gram models, feedforward neural networks, recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and Transformers on small-scale datasets. Overall, well-regularized RNNs give the best performance across two isiZulu and one Sepedi datasets. Multilingual training further improves performance on these datasets.

Analyzing Formality Distribution across Languages,"Asım Ersoy, Gerson Vizcarra, Tasmiah Tahsin Mayeesha, Benjamin Muller","Multilingual generative language models (LMs) are increasingly fluent in a large variety of languages. Trained on the concatenation of corpora in multiple languages, they enable powerful transfer from high-resource languages to low-resource ones. However, it is still unknown what cultural biases are induced in the predictions of these models. In this work, we focus on one language property highly influenced by culture: formality. We analyze the formality distributions of XGLM and BLOOM's predictions, two popular generative multilingual language models, in 5 languages. We classify 1,200 generations per language as formal, informal, or incohesive and measure the impact of the prompt formality on the predictions. Overall, we observe a diversity of behaviors across the models and languages. For instance, XGLM generates informal text in Arabic and Bengali when conditioned with informal prompts, much more than BLOOM. In addition, even though both models are highly biased toward the formal style when prompted neutrally, we find that the models generate a significant amount of informal predictions even when prompted with formal text. We release with this work 6,000 annotated samples, paving the way for future work on the formality of generative multilingual LMs.",LLM,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.12299v1.pdf

It is important to protect the model weights to avoid malicious usage that violates licenses of open-source large language models. This paper proposes a novel watermarking strategy that plants watermarks in the quantization process of large language models without pre-defined triggers during inference. The watermark works when the model is used in the fp32 mode and remains hidden when the model is quantized to int8, in this way, the users can only inference the model without further supervised fine-tuning of the model. We successfully plant the watermark into open-source large language model weights including GPT-Neo and LLaMA.

Many languages lack a large corpus to train a decent LLM; therefore existing LLMs rarely perform well in unseen, endangered languages. On the contrary, we observe that 2000 endangered languages, though without a large corpus, have a grammar book or a dictionary. We propose LINGOLLM, a training-free approach to enable an LLM to process unseen languages that hardly occur in its pre-training. Our key insight is to demonstrate linguistic knowledge of an unseen language in an LLM's prompt, including a dictionary, a grammar book, and morphologically analyzed input text. We implement LINGOLLM on top of two models, GPT-4 and Mixtral, and evaluate their performance on 5 tasks across 8 endangered or low-resource languages. Our results show that LINGOLLM elevates translation capability from GPT-4's 0 to 10.5 BLEU for 10 language directions. Our findings demonstrate the tremendous value of linguistic knowledge in the age of LLMs for endangered languages.

In the human brain, neuroscience has identified a core language system that selectively and causally supports language processing. We here ask whether similar specialization for language emerges in LLMs. We identify language-selective units within 18 popular LLMs, using the same localization approach that is used in neuroscience. We then establish the causal role of these units by demonstrating that ablating LLM language-selective units -- but not random units -- leads to drastic deficits in language tasks. Correspondingly, language-selective LLM units are more aligned to brain recordings from the human language system than random units. Finally, we investigate whether our localization method extends to other cognitive domains: while we find specialized networks in some LLMs for reasoning and social capabilities, there are substantial differences among models. These findings provide functional and causal evidence for specialization in large language models, and highlight parallels with the functional organization in the brain.",LLM,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.02280v2.pdf

Building language models and, more generally, NLP systems for non-standardized and low-resource languages remains a challenging task. In this work, we focus on North-African colloquial dialectal Arabic written using an extension of the Latin script, called NArabizi, found mostly on social media and messaging communication. In this low-resource scenario with data displaying a high level of variability, we compare the downstream performance of a character-based language model on part-of-speech tagging and dependency parsing to that of monolingual and multilingual models. We show that a character-based model trained on only 99k sentences of NArabizi and fined-tuned on a small treebank of this language leads to performance close to those obtained with the same architecture pre-trained on large multilingual and monolingual models. Confirming these results a on much larger data set of noisy French user-generated content, we argue that such character-based language models can be an asset for NLP in low-resource and high language variability set-tings.",LLM,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.13658v1.pdf

We prompt the large language model with a serialization of the tabular data to a natural-language string, together with a short description of the classification problem. In the few-shot setting, we fine-tune the large language model using some labeled examples. We evaluate several serialization methods including templates, table-to-text models, and large language models. Despite its simplicity, we find that this technique outperforms prior deep-learning-based tabular classification methods on several benchmark datasets. In most cases, even zero-shot classification obtains non-trivial performance, illustrating the method's ability to exploit prior knowledge encoded in large language models. Unlike many deep learning methods for tabular datasets, this approach is also competitive with strong traditional baselines like gradient-boosted trees, especially in the very-few-shot setting.",LLM,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.10723v2.pdf

To address this issue, this paper presents vi-mistral-x, an innovative Large Language Model designed expressly for the Vietnamese language. It utilizes a unique method of continual pre-training, based on the Mistral architecture, which incorporates grouped-query attention and sliding window attention techniques. This model, vi-Mistral-X, marks a significant step forward in improving the understanding and generation of the Vietnamese language. It introduces an additional phase of continual pre-training, specifically adapted for Vietnamese, enhancing the model's capability in understanding complex language nuances and generating accurate, context-aware Vietnamese text. Through comprehensive testing on various benchmarks, vi-mistral-x has shown to outperform existing Vietnamese LLMs in several key areas, including text classification, question answering, and text generation. Particularly, in the Vietnamese Multitask Language Understanding (VMLU) benchmark, vi-mistral-x sets a new standard, outperforming other available models significantly. This paper highlights the critical role of continual pre-training in advancing language-specific LLMs and opens new avenues for the development of multilingual models. We aim for vi-mistral-x to not just be an important asset for processing the Vietnamese language but also to encourage more advancements in creating large language models for languages that are less represented.",LLM,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.15470v1.pdf

First, we outline how standard language ideology is reflected and reinforced in LLMs. We then present a taxonomy of open problems regarding standard language ideology in AI-generated language with implications for minoritized language communities. We introduce the concept of standard AI-generated language ideology, the process by which AI-generated language regards Standard American English (SAE) as a linguistic default and reinforces a linguistic bias that SAE is the most ""appropriate"" language. Finally, we discuss tensions that remain, including reflecting on what desirable system behavior looks like, as well as advantages and drawbacks of generative AI tools imitating--or often not--different English language varieties. Throughout, we discuss standard language ideology as a manifestation of existing global power structures in and through AI-generated language before ending with questions to move towards alternative, more emancipatory digital futures.",LLM,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.08726v1.pdf

In this paper, we focus on the trustworthiness of language models with respect to retrieval augmentation. Despite being supported with external evidence, retrieval-augmented generation still suffers from hallucinations, one primary cause of which is the conflict between contextual and parametric knowledge. We deem that retrieval-augmented language models have the inherent capabilities of supplying response according to both contextual and parametric knowledge. Inspired by aligning language models with human preference, we take the first step towards aligning retrieval-augmented language models to a status where it responds relying merely on the external evidence and disregards the interference of parametric knowledge. Specifically, we propose a reinforcement learning based algorithm Trustworthy-Alignment, theoretically and experimentally demonstrating large language models' capability of reaching a trustworthy status without explicit supervision on how to respond. Our work highlights the potential of large language models on exploring its intrinsic abilities by its own and expands the application scenarios of alignment from fulfilling human preference to creating trustworthy agents.",LLM,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.16843v1.pdf
2412.00471v1,LLaMA-Gene: A General-purpose Gene Task Large Language Model Based on   Instruction Fine-tuning,Wang Liang,"Building a general-purpose task model similar to ChatGPT has been an important research direction for gene large language models. Instruction fine-tuning is a key component in building ChatGPT, but existing instructions are primarily based on natural language. Natural language and gene sequences have significant differences in tokenization and encoding. Therefore, constructing a multilingual model that can handle both natural language and gene sequences is crucial for solving this problem.In this paper, we expand the capabilities of the LLaMA large language model to include gene language. This involves expanding the vocabulary using the Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) method, specifically tailored for DNA and protein sequences, and conducting further pre-training on these sequences. We then convert various downstream gene task data into a unified format for instruction fine-tuning and further fine-tune the model on this data.Our study demonstrates that a mixed model of gene and natural language, fine-tuned with instructions, achieves results comparable to the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) in tasks such as gene classification and gene sequence interaction. This provides a promising direction for building a unified large language model for gene tasks.",LLM,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.00471v1.pdf

However, the evaluation of their performance in domain-specific tasks, particularly those requiring deep natural language understanding, has received less attention. In this research, we evaluate the ability of large language models in performing domain-specific tasks, focusing on the multi-hop question answering (MHQA) problem using the HotpotQA dataset. This task, due to its requirement for reasoning and combining information from multiple textual sources, serves as a challenging benchmark for assessing the language comprehension capabilities of these models. To tackle this problem, we have designed a two-stage selector-reader architecture, where each stage utilizes an independent LLM. In addition, methods such as Chain of Thought (CoT) and question decomposition have been employed to investigate their impact on improving the model's performance. The results of the study show that the integration of large language models with these techniques can lead to up to a 4% improvement in F1 score for finding answers, providing evidence of the models' ability to handle domain-specific tasks and their understanding of complex language.",LLM,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.06286v1.pdf
2409.16911v2,Pruning Multilingual Large Language Models for Multilingual Inference,"Hwichan Kim, Jun Suzuki, Tosho Hirasawa, Mamoru Komachi","Multilingual large language models (MLLMs), trained on multilingual balanced data, demonstrate better zero-shot learning performance in non-English languages compared to large language models trained on English-dominant data. However, the disparity in performance between English and non-English languages remains a challenge yet to be fully addressed. A distinctive characteristic of MLLMs is their high-quality translation capabilities, indicating an acquired proficiency in aligning between languages. This study explores how to enhance the zero-shot performance of MLLMs in non-English languages by leveraging their alignment capability between English and non-English languages. To achieve this, we first analyze the behavior of MLLMs when performing translation and reveal that there are large magnitude features that play a critical role in the translation process. Inspired by these findings, we retain the weights associated with operations involving the large magnitude features and prune other weights to force MLLMs to rely on these features for tasks beyond translation. We empirically demonstrate that this pruning strategy can enhance the MLLMs' performance in non-English language.",LLM,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.16911v2.pdf

Some prior works show that pre-trained language models can capture the syntactic rules of natural languages without finetuning on syntax understanding tasks. However, there is limited understanding of how well pre-trained models understand the code structure so far. In this work, we perform the first thorough benchmarking of the state-of-the-art pre-trained models for identifying the syntactic structures of programs. Specifically, we introduce CodeSyntax, a large-scale dataset of programs annotated with the syntactic relationships in their corresponding abstract syntax trees. Our key observation is that existing language models pretrained on code still lack the understanding of code syntax. In fact, these pre-trained programming language models fail to match the performance of simple baselines based on positional offsets and keywords. We also present a natural language benchmark to highlight the differences between natural languages and programming languages in terms of syntactic structure understanding. Our findings point out key limitations of existing pre-training methods for programming languages, and suggest the importance of modeling code syntactic structures.",LLM,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.14473v1.pdf

Ziabari, Morteza Dehghani","Multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) develop cross-lingual abilities despite being trained on limited parallel data. However, they often struggle to generate responses in the intended language, favoring high-resource languages such as English. In this work, we introduce CoCo-CoLa (Correct Concept - Correct Language), a novel metric to evaluate language adherence in multilingual LLMs. Using fine-tuning experiments on a closed-book QA task across seven languages, we analyze how training in one language affects others' performance. Our findings reveal that multilingual models share task knowledge across languages but exhibit biases in the selection of output language. We identify language-specific layers, showing that final layers play a crucial role in determining output language. Accordingly, we propose a partial training strategy that selectively fine-tunes key layers, improving language adherence while significantly reducing computational cost. Our method achieves comparable or superior performance to full fine-tuning, particularly for low-resource languages, offering a more efficient multilingual adaptation.",LLM,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.12476v1.pdf

Existing ensemble methods, whether applied at the token or output levels, fail to address these challenges. In response, we present Language model Ensemble with Monte Carlo Tree Search (LE-MCTS), a novel framework for process-level ensembling of language models. LE-MCTS formulates step-by-step reasoning with an ensemble of language models as a Markov decision process. In this framework, states represent intermediate reasoning paths, while actions consist of generating the next reasoning step using one of the language models selected from a predefined pool. Guided by a process-based reward model, LE-MCTS performs a tree search over the reasoning steps generated by different language models, identifying the most accurate reasoning chain. Experimental results on five mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our approach outperforms both single language model decoding algorithms and language model ensemble methods. Notably, LE-MCTS improves performance by 3.6% and 4.3% on the MATH and MQA datasets, respectively, highlighting its effectiveness in solving complex reasoning problems.",LLM,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.15797v1.pdf

Enhancing non-English language capabilities through post-pretraining often results in catastrophic forgetting of the ability of original languages. Previous methods either achieve good expansion with severe forgetting or slight forgetting with poor expansion, indicating the challenge of balancing language expansion while preventing forgetting. In this paper, we propose a method called MoE-LPR (Mixture-of-Experts with Language Priors Routing) to alleviate this problem. MoE-LPR employs a two-stage training approach to enhance the multilingual capability. First, the model is post-pretrained into a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture by upcycling, where all the original parameters are frozen and new experts are added. In this stage, we focus improving the ability on expanded languages, without using any original language data. Then, the model reviews the knowledge of the original languages with replay data amounting to less than 1% of post-pretraining, where we incorporate language priors routing to better recover the abilities of the original languages. Evaluations on multiple benchmarks show that MoE-LPR outperforms other post-pretraining methods. Freezing original parameters preserves original language knowledge while adding new experts preserves the learning ability. Reviewing with LPR enables effective utilization of multilingual knowledge within the parameters. Additionally, the MoE architecture maintains the same inference overhead while increasing total model parameters. Extensive experiments demonstrate MoE-LPR's effectiveness in improving expanded languages and preserving original language proficiency with superior scalability.

2310.16937v2,Learning Transfers over Several Programming Languages,"Razan Baltaji, Saurabh Pujar, Louis Mandel, Martin Hirzel, Luca Buratti, Lav Varshney","Large language models (LLMs) have become remarkably good at improving developer productivity for high-resource programming languages. These models use two kinds of data: large amounts of unlabeled code samples for pre-training and relatively smaller amounts of labeled code samples for fine-tuning or in-context learning. Unfortunately, many programming languages are low-resource, lacking labeled samples for most tasks and often even lacking unlabeled samples. Therefore, users of low-resource languages (e.g., legacy or new languages) miss out on the benefits of LLMs. Cross-lingual transfer uses data from a source language to improve model performance on a target language. It has been well-studied for natural languages, but has received little attention for programming languages. This paper reports extensive experiments on four tasks using a transformer-based LLM and 11 to 41 programming languages to explore the following questions. First, how well does cross-lingual transfer work for a given task across different language pairs. Second, given a task and target language, how should one choose a source language. Third, which characteristics of a language pair are predictive of transfer performance, and how does that depend on the given task. Our empirical study with 1,808 experiments reveals practical and scientific insights, such as Kotlin and JavaScript being the most transferable source languages and different tasks relying on substantially different features. Overall, we find that learning transfers well across several programming languages.",LLM,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.16937v2.pdf

We explore the latter approach using the off-the-shelf alignment module and train a hidden Markov model(HMM) to predict the POS tags. We evaluate transfer learning setup with English as a source language and French, German, and Spanish as target languages for part-of-speech tagging. Our conclusion is that projected alignment data in zero-resource language can be beneficial to predict POS tags.",LLM,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.05727v1.pdf

Thus, it is important for real-world dialog systems to be able to handle popular figurative language constructs like metaphor and simile. In this work, we analyze the performance of existing dialog models in situations where the input dialog context exhibits use of figurative language. We observe large gaps in handling of figurative language when evaluating the models on two open domain dialog datasets. When faced with dialog contexts consisting of figurative language, some models show very large drops in performance compared to contexts without figurative language. We encourage future research in dialog modeling to separately analyze and report results on figurative language in order to better test model capabilities relevant to real-world use. Finally, we propose lightweight solutions to help existing models become more robust to figurative language by simply using an external resource to translate figurative language to literal (non-figurative) forms while preserving the meaning to the best extent possible.",LLM,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.00687v1.pdf

This paper probes the performance of ChatGPT, a sophisticated language model by OpenAI in tackling such complex reasoning tasks, using chess as a case study. Through robust metrics examining both the legality and quality of moves, we assess ChatGPT's understanding of the chessboard, adherence to chess rules, and strategic decision-making abilities. Our evaluation identifies limitations within ChatGPT's attention mechanism that affect its formal language comprehension and uncovers the model's underdeveloped self-regulation abilities. Our study also reveals ChatGPT's propensity for a coherent strategy in its gameplay and a noticeable uptick in decision-making assertiveness when the model is presented with a greater volume of natural language or possesses a more lucid understanding of the state of the chessboard.

We introduce, Sign2GPT, a novel framework for sign language translation that utilizes large-scale pretrained vision and language models via lightweight adapters for gloss-free sign language translation. The lightweight adapters are crucial for sign language translation, due to the constraints imposed by limited dataset sizes and the computational requirements when training with long sign videos. We also propose a novel pretraining strategy that directs our encoder to learn sign representations from automatically extracted pseudo-glosses without requiring gloss order information or annotations.

We investigate the impact of parallel corpora quality and quantity, training objectives, and model size on the performance of multilingual large language models enhanced with parallel corpora across diverse languages and tasks. Our analysis reveals several key insights: (i) filtering noisy translations is essential for effectively exploiting parallel corpora, while language identification and short sentence filtering have little effect; (ii) even a corpus with just 10K parallel sentences can yield results comparable to those obtained from much larger datasets; (iii) employing only the machine translation objective yields the best results among various training objectives and their combinations; (iv) larger multilingual language models benefit more from parallel corpora than smaller models.

Incorporating graph knowledge provides a reliable source of information, enabling potential solutions to address issues in text generation, e.g., hallucination, and lack of domain knowledge. To evaluate the integration of graph knowledge into language models, a dedicated dataset is needed. However, there is currently no benchmark dataset specifically designed for multimodal graph-language models. To address this gap, we propose GraphextQA, a question answering dataset with paired subgraphs, retrieved from Wikidata, to facilitate the evaluation and future development of graph-language models. Additionally, we introduce a baseline model called CrossGNN, which conditions answer generation on the paired graphs by cross-attending question-aware graph features at decoding.

2502.13433v2,MATS: An Audio Language Model under Text-only Supervision,"Wen Wang, Ruibing Hou, Hong Chang, Shiguang Shan, Xilin Chen","Large audio-language models (LALMs), built upon powerful Large Language Models (LLMs), have exhibited remarkable audio comprehension and reasoning capabilities. However, the training of LALMs demands a large corpus of audio-language pairs, which requires substantial costs in both data collection and training resources. In this paper, we propose MATS, an audio-language multimodal LLM designed to handle Multiple Audio task using solely Text-only Supervision. By leveraging pre-trained audio-language alignment models such as CLAP, we develop a text-only training strategy that projects the shared audio-language latent space into LLM latent space, endowing the LLM with audio comprehension capabilities without relying on audio data during training. To further bridge the modality gap between audio and language embeddings within CLAP, we propose the Strongly-related noisy text with audio (Santa) mechanism. Santa maps audio embeddings into CLAP language embedding space while preserving essential information from the audio input. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MATS, despite being trained exclusively on text data, achieves competitive performance compared to recent LALMs trained on large-scale audio-language pairs.",LLM,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.13433v2.pdf
2311.05741v2,Efficiently Adapting Pretrained Language Models To New Languages,"Zoltan Csaki, Pian Pawakapan, Urmish Thakker, Qiantong Xu","Recent large language models (LLM) exhibit sub-optimal performance on low-resource languages, as the training data of these models is usually dominated by English and other high-resource languages. Furthermore, it is challenging to train models for low-resource languages, especially from scratch, due to a lack of high quality training data. Adapting pretrained LLMs reduces the need for data in the new language while also providing cross lingual transfer capabilities. However, naively adapting to new languages leads to catastrophic forgetting and poor tokenizer efficiency. In this work, we study how to efficiently adapt any existing pretrained LLM to a new language without running into these issues. In particular, we improve the encoding efficiency of the tokenizer by adding new tokens from the target language and study the data mixing recipe to mitigate forgetting. Our experiments on adapting an English LLM to Hungarian and Thai show that our recipe can reach better performance than open source models on the target language, with minimal regressions on English.",LLM,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.05741v2.pdf

Our goal is to enhance the reasoning capabilities of language-specific LLMs while maintaining their target language abilities. DeepSeek R1 excels in reasoning but primarily benefits high-resource languages such as English and Chinese. However, low-resource languages remain underserved due to the dominance of English-centric training data and model optimizations, which limit performance in these languages. This limitation results in unreliable code-switching and diminished effectiveness on tasks in low-resource languages. Meanwhile, local and regional LLM initiatives have attempted to bridge this gap by developing language-specific LLMs that focus on improving local linguistic fidelity. We demonstrate that, with only publicly available datasets and a computational budget of $120, it is possible to enhance the reasoning capabilities of language-specific LLMs to match the level of DeepSeek R1, without compromising their performance on target language tasks.",LLM,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.09056v3.pdf

One common approach to mitigate this issue is to translate training data from resource-rich languages into other languages and then continue training. However, using the data obtained solely relying on translation while ignoring the original capabilities of LLMs across languages is not always effective, which we show will limit the performance of cross-lingual knowledge transfer. In this work, we propose SDRRL, a method based on Self-Distillation from Resource-Rich Languages that effectively improve multilingual performance by leveraging the internal capabilities of LLMs on resource-rich languages. We evaluate on different LLMs (LLaMA-2 and SeaLLM) and source languages across various comprehension and generation tasks, experimental results demonstrate that SDRRL can significantly enhance multilingual capabilities while minimizing the impact on original performance in resource-rich languages.",LLM,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.12204v1.pdf

This study explores how LLMs handle multilingualism. Based on observed language ratio shifts among layers and the relationships between network structures and certain capabilities, we hypothesize the LLM's multilingual workflow ($\texttt{MWork}$): LLMs initially understand the query, converting multilingual inputs into English for task-solving. In the intermediate layers, they employ English for thinking and incorporate multilingual knowledge with self-attention and feed-forward structures, respectively. In the final layers, LLMs generate responses aligned with the original language of the query. To verify $\texttt{MWork}$, we introduce Parallel Language-specific Neuron Detection ($\texttt{PLND}$) to identify activated neurons for inputs in different languages without any labeled data. Using $\texttt{PLND}$, we validate $\texttt{MWork}$ through extensive experiments involving the deactivation of language-specific neurons across various layers and structures. Moreover, $\texttt{MWork}$ allows fine-tuning of language-specific neurons with a small dataset, enhancing multilingual abilities in a specific language without compromising others. This approach results in an average improvement of $3.6\%$ for high-resource languages and $2.3\%$ for low-resource languages across all tasks with just $400$ documents.",LLM,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.18815v3.pdf

Recent studies have highlighted the limitations of LLMs in low-resource languages, primarily focusing on binary classification tasks and giving minimal attention to South Asian languages. These limitations are primarily attributed to constraints such as dataset scarcity, computational costs, and research gaps specific to low-resource languages. To address this gap, we present datasets for sentiment and hate speech tasks by translating from English to Bangla, Hindi, and Urdu, facilitating research in low-resource language processing. Further, we comprehensively examine zero-shot learning using multiple LLMs in English and widely spoken South Asian languages. Our findings indicate that GPT-4 consistently outperforms Llama 2 and Gemini, with English consistently demonstrating superior performance across diverse tasks compared to low-resource languages. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that natural language inference (NLI) exhibits the highest performance among the evaluated tasks, with GPT-4 demonstrating superior capabilities.",LLM,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.02237v1.pdf

This phenomenon presents a critical challenge in text generation by LLMs, often appearing as erratic and unpredictable behavior. We hypothesize that there are linguistic regularities to this inherent vulnerability in LLMs and shed light on patterns of language confusion across LLMs. We introduce a novel metric, Language Confusion Entropy, designed to directly measure and quantify this confusion, based on language distributions informed by linguistic typology and lexical variation. Comprehensive comparisons with the Language Confusion Benchmark (Marchisio et al., 2024) confirm the effectiveness of our metric, revealing patterns of language confusion across LLMs. We further link language confusion to LLM security, and find patterns in the case of multilingual embedding inversion attacks. Our analysis demonstrates that linguistic typology offers theoretically grounded interpretation, and valuable insights into leveraging language similarities as a prior for LLM alignment and security.",LLM,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.13237v2.pdf

Second, we pretrain new Transformer language models following the RoBERTa pretraining technique to supplant existing models trained with small corpora.

2210.06525v1,Subword Segmental Language Modelling for Nguni Languages,"Francois Meyer, Jan Buys","Subwords have become the standard units of text in NLP, enabling efficient open-vocabulary models. With algorithms like byte-pair encoding (BPE), subword segmentation is viewed as a preprocessing step applied to the corpus before training. This can lead to sub-optimal segmentations for low-resource languages with complex morphologies. We propose a subword segmental language model (SSLM) that learns how to segment words while being trained for autoregressive language modelling. By unifying subword segmentation and language modelling, our model learns subwords that optimise LM performance. We train our model on the 4 Nguni languages of South Africa. These are low-resource agglutinative languages, so subword information is critical. As an LM, SSLM outperforms existing approaches such as BPE-based models on average across the 4 languages. Furthermore, it outperforms standard subword segmenters on unsupervised morphological segmentation. We also train our model as a word-level sequence model, resulting in an unsupervised morphological segmenter that outperforms existing methods by a large margin for all 4 languages. Our results show that learning subword segmentation is an effective alternative to existing subword segmenters, enabling the model to discover morpheme-like subwords that improve its LM capabilities.",LLM,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.06525v1.pdf
2405.07745v1,LlamaTurk: Adapting Open-Source Generative Large Language Models for   Low-Resource Language,Cagri Toraman,"Despite advancements in English-dominant generative large language models, further development is needed for low-resource languages to enhance global accessibility. The primary methods for representing these languages are monolingual and multilingual pretraining. Monolingual pretraining is expensive due to hardware requirements, and multilingual models often have uneven performance across languages. This study explores an alternative solution by adapting large language models, primarily trained on English, to low-resource languages. We assess various strategies, including continual training, instruction fine-tuning, task-specific fine-tuning, and vocabulary extension. The results show that continual training improves language comprehension, as reflected in perplexity scores, and task-specific tuning generally enhances performance of downstream tasks. However, extending the vocabulary shows no substantial benefits. Additionally, while larger models improve task performance with few-shot tuning, multilingual models perform worse than their monolingual counterparts when adapted.",LLM,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.07745v1.pdf

This paper proposes BLIP-2, a generic and efficient pre-training strategy that bootstraps vision-language pre-training from off-the-shelf frozen pre-trained image encoders and frozen large language models. BLIP-2 bridges the modality gap with a lightweight Querying Transformer, which is pre-trained in two stages. The first stage bootstraps vision-language representation learning from a frozen image encoder. The second stage bootstraps vision-to-language generative learning from a frozen language model. BLIP-2 achieves state-of-the-art performance on various vision-language tasks, despite having significantly fewer trainable parameters than existing methods. For example, our model outperforms Flamingo80B by 8.7% on zero-shot VQAv2 with 54x fewer trainable parameters.

Smith, Yulia Tsvetkov","Language models have graduated from being research prototypes to commercialized products offered as web APIs, and recent works have highlighted the multilingual capabilities of these products. The API vendors charge their users based on usage, more specifically on the number of ``tokens'' processed or generated by the underlying language models. What constitutes a token, however, is training data and model dependent with a large variance in the number of tokens required to convey the same information in different languages. In this work, we analyze the effect of this non-uniformity on the fairness of an API's pricing policy across languages. We conduct a systematic analysis of the cost and utility of OpenAI's language model API on multilingual benchmarks in 22 typologically diverse languages. We show evidence that speakers of a large number of the supported languages are overcharged while obtaining poorer results. These speakers tend to also come from regions where the APIs are less affordable to begin with. Through these analyses, we aim to increase transparency around language model APIs' pricing policies and encourage the vendors to make them more equitable.",LLM,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.13707v1.pdf

In this paper, we present LLMic, a bilingual foundation language model designed specifically for the Romanian Language. We document the complete process of pretraining a foundation model for a low-resource language, including corpus construction, architecture selection, and hyper-parameter optimization. Our evaluation demonstrates that LLMic can be specialized for tasks in the target language, achieving results comparable to other much larger open models. We show that fine-tuning LLMic for language translation after the initial pretraining phase outperforms existing solutions in English-to-Romanian translation tasks.

It may arise from the lack of high-quality instruction following data in these languages. Directly translating English samples into these languages can be a solution but unreliable, leading to responses with translation errors and lacking language-specific or cultural knowledge. To address this issue, we propose a novel method to construct cross-lingual instruction following samples with instruction in English and response in low-resource languages. Specifically, the language model first learns to generate appropriate English instructions according to the natural web texts in other languages as responses. The candidate cross-lingual instruction tuning samples are further refined and diversified. We have employed this method to build a large-scale cross-lingual instruction tuning dataset on 10 languages, namely X-Instruction. The instruction data built using our method incorporate more language-specific knowledge compared with the naive translation method. Experimental results have shown that the response quality of the model tuned on X-Instruction greatly exceeds the model distilled from a powerful teacher model, reaching or even surpassing the ones of ChatGPT. In addition, we find that models tuned on cross-lingual instruction following samples can follow the instruction in the output language without further tuning.",LLM,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.19744v1.pdf

The language model is used in a bootstrapping fashion to refine predictions in the target language for use as ground truth in training the model.Using this approach we demonstrate improved transferability among French, English, and Spanish languages using both historical and modern handwriting datasets.

Besides the common concept, these methods turn out to be even more tightly related, to the point of algorithmical reducibility of one technique to another. The goal of the present paper is to demonstrate these relations.   The paper offers a plain-term interpretation of Culik's image compression, in regular image processing terms, without resorting to finite state machines and similar lofty language. The interpretation is shown to be algorithmically related to an IFS fractal image compression method: an IFS can be exactly transformed into Culik's image code. Using this transformation, we will prove that in a self-similar (part of an) image any zero wavelet coefficient is the root of a zerotree, or its branch.   The paper discusses the zerotree coding of (wavelet/projection) coefficients as a common predictor/corrector, applied vertically through different layers of a multiresolutional decomposition, rather than within the same view. This interpretation leads to an insight into the evolution of image compression techniques: from a causal single-layer prediction, to non-causal same-view predictions (wavelet decomposition among others) and to a causal cross-layer prediction (zero-trees, Culik's method).",CV,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0003065v1.pdf

0307045v1,Flexible Camera Calibration Using a New Analytical Radial Undistortion   Formula with Application to Mobile Robot Localization,"Lili Ma, YangQuan Chen, Kevin L. Moore","Most algorithms in 3D computer vision rely on the pinhole camera model because of its simplicity, whereas virtually all imaging devices introduce certain amount of nonlinear distortion, where the radial distortion is the most severe part. Common approach to radial distortion is by the means of polynomial approximation, which introduces distortion-specific parameters into the camera model and requires estimation of these distortion parameters. The task of estimating radial distortion is to find a radial distortion model that allows easy undistortion as well as satisfactory accuracy. This paper presents a new radial distortion model with an easy analytical undistortion formula, which also belongs to the polynomial approximation category. Experimental results are presented to show that with this radial distortion model, satisfactory accuracy is achieved.

The task of estimating radial distortion is to find a radial distortion model that allows easy undistortion as well as satisfactory accuracy. This paper presents a new piecewise radial distortion model with easy analytical undistortion formula. The motivation for seeking a piecewise radial distortion model is that, when a camera is resulted in a low quality during manufacturing, the nonlinear radial distortion can be complex. Using low order polynomials to approximate the radial distortion might not be precise enough. On the other hand, higher order polynomials suffer from the inverse problem. With the new piecewise radial distortion function, more flexibility is obtained and the radial undistortion can be performed analytically. Experimental results are presented to show that with this new piecewise radial distortion model, better performance is achieved than that using the single function. Furthermore, a comparable performance with the conventional polynomial model using 2 coefficients can also be accomplished.",CV,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0307051v1.pdf

Moore","The commonly used radial distortion model for camera calibration is in fact an assumption or a restriction. In practice, camera distortion could happen in a general geometrical manner that is not limited to the radial sense. This paper proposes a simplified geometrical distortion modeling method by using two different radial distortion functions in the two image axes. A family of simplified geometric distortion models is proposed, which are either simple polynomials or the rational functions of polynomials. Analytical geometric undistortion is possible using two of the distortion functions discussed in this paper and their performance can be improved by applying a piecewise fitting idea. Our experimental results show that the geometrical distortion models always perform better than their radial distortion counterparts. Furthermore, the proposed geometric modeling method is more appropriate for cameras whose distortion is not perfectly radially symmetric around the center of distortion.",CV,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0308003v1.pdf

Researchers have traditionally used combinations of morphological operations to remove the noise inherent in the background-subtracted result. Such techniques can effectively isolate foreground objects, but tend to lose fidelity around the borders of the segmentation, especially for noisy input. This paper explores the use of a minimum graph cut algorithm to segment the foreground, resulting in qualitatively and quantitiatively cleaner segmentations. Experiments on both artificial and real data show that the graph-based method reduces the error around segmented foreground objects.

Because $k_1\ne k_2$, the supports of the basis elements are rectangles, and the corresponding transform is known as the {\em rectangular wavelet transform}. We prove that if one-dimensional wavelet basis has $M$ dual vanishing moments then the rate of approximation by $N$ coefficients of rectangular wavelet transform is $\mathcal{O}(N^{-M}\log^C N)$ for functions with mixed derivative of order $M$ in each direction.   The square wavelet transform yields the approximation rate is $\mathcal{O}(N^{-M/2})$ for functions with all derivatives of the total order $M$. Thus, the rectangular wavelet transform can outperform the square one if an image has a mixed derivative.

This method has been applied together with snake models for boundary extraction medical images segmentation. The key idea is to use a diffusion-reaction PDE to generate a new external force field that makes snake models less sensitivity to initialization as well as improves the snake's ability to move into boundary concavities. In this paper, we firstly review basic results about convergence and numerical analysis of usual GVF schemes. We point out that GVF presents numerical problems due to discontinuities image intensity. This point is considered from a practical viewpoint from which the GVF parameters must follow a relationship in order to improve numerical convergence. Besides, we present an analytical analysis of the GVF dependency from the parameters values. Also, we observe that the method can be used for multiply connected domains by just imposing the suitable boundary condition. In the experimental results we verify these theoretical points and demonstrate the utility of GVF on a segmentation approach that we have developed based on snakes.",CV,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0502095v2.pdf

This paper posits a new image information content definition. Following the theory of Solomonoff-Kolmogorov-Chaitin's complexity, we define image information content as a set of descriptions of imafe data structures. Three levels of such description can be generally distinguished: 1)the global level, where the coarse structure of the entire scene is initially outlined; 2) the intermediate level, where structures of separate, non-overlapping image regions usually associated with individual scene objects are deliniated; and 3) the low-level description, where local image structures observed in a limited and restricted field of view are resolved. A technique for creating such image information content descriptors is developed. Its algorithm is presented and elucidated with some examples, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",CV,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0505006v1.pdf
0507058v1,Paving the Way for Image Understanding: A New Kind of Image   Decomposition is Desired,Emanuel Diamant,"In this paper we present an unconventional image segmentation approach which is devised to meet the requirements of image understanding and pattern recognition tasks. Generally image understanding assumes interplay of two sub-processes: image information content discovery and image information content interpretation. Despite of its widespread use, the notion of ""image information content"" is still ill defined, intuitive, and ambiguous. Most often, it is used in the Shannon's sense, which means information content assessment averaged over the whole signal ensemble. Humans, however,rarely resort to such estimates. They are very effective in decomposing images into their meaningful constituents and focusing attention to the perceptually relevant image parts. We posit that following the latest findings in human attention vision studies and the concepts of Kolmogorov's complexity theory an unorthodox segmentation approach can be proposed that provides effective image decomposition to information preserving image fragments well suited for subsequent image interpretation. We provide some illustrative examples, demonstrating effectiveness of this approach.",CV,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0507058v1.pdf

In the proposed algorithm the whole image is converted from the spatial to polar frequency domain by a Fourier-Bessel Transform (FBT). Using the whole image is compared to the case where only face image regions (local analysis) are considered. The resulting representations are embedded in a dissimilarity space, where each image is represented by its distance to all the other images, and a Pseudo-Fisher discriminator is built. Verification test results on the FERET database showed that the local-based algorithm outperforms the global-FBT version. The local-FBT algorithm performed as state-of-the-art methods under different testing conditions, indicating that the proposed system is highly robust for expression, age, and illumination variations. We also evaluated the performance of the proposed system under strong occlusion conditions and found that it is highly robust for up to 50% of face occlusion. Finally, we automated completely the verification system by implementing face and eye detection algorithms. Under this condition, the local approach was only slightly superior to the global approach.",CV,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0509081v1.pdf
0509082v1,Face Recognition Based on Polar Frequency Features,"Yossi Zana, Roberto M. Cesar-JR","A novel biologically motivated face recognition algorithm based on polar frequency is presented. Polar frequency descriptors are extracted from face images by Fourier-Bessel transform (FBT). Next, the Euclidean distance between all images is computed and each image is now represented by its dissimilarity to the other images. A Pseudo-Fisher Linear Discriminant was built on this dissimilarity space. The performance of Discrete Fourier transform (DFT) descriptors, and a combination of both feature types was also evaluated. The algorithms were tested on a 40- and 1196-subjects face database (ORL and FERET, respectively). With 5 images per subject in the training and test datasets, error rate on the ORL database was 3.8, 1.25 and 0.2% for the FBT, DFT, and the combined classifier, respectively, as compared to 2.6% achieved by the best previous algorithm. The most informative polar frequency features were concentrated at low-to-medium angular frequencies coupled to low radial frequencies. On the FERET database, where an affine normalization pre-processing was applied, the FBT algorithm outperformed only the PCA in a rank recognition test. However, it achieved performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods when evaluated by verification tests. These results indicate the high informative value of the polar frequency content of face images in relation to recognition and verification tasks, and that the Cartesian frequency content can complement information about the subjects' identity, but possibly only when the images are not pre-normalized. Possible implications for human face recognition are discussed.",CV,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0509082v1.pdf

The resulting representations are embedded in a dissimilarity space, where each image is represented by its distance to all the other images. In this dissimilarity space a Pseudo-Fisher discriminator is built. ROC and equal error rate verification test results on the FERET database showed that the system performed at least as state-of-the-art methods and better than a system based on polar Fourier features.

Cree","We present a method for automated segmentation of the vasculature in retinal images. The method produces segmentations by classifying each image pixel as vessel or non-vessel, based on the pixel's feature vector. Feature vectors are composed of the pixel's intensity and continuous two-dimensional Morlet wavelet transform responses taken at multiple scales. The Morlet wavelet is capable of tuning to specific frequencies, thus allowing noise filtering and vessel enhancement in a single step. We use a Bayesian classifier with class-conditional probability density functions (likelihoods) described as Gaussian mixtures, yielding a fast classification, while being able to model complex decision surfaces and compare its performance with the linear minimum squared error classifier. The probability distributions are estimated based on a training set of labeled pixels obtained from manual segmentations. The method's performance is evaluated on publicly available DRIVE and STARE databases of manually labeled non-mydriatic images. On the DRIVE database, it achieves an area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of 0.9598, being slightly superior than that presented by the method of Staal et al.",CV,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0510001v2.pdf
0510026v1,A decision support system for ship identification based on the curvature   scale space representation,"Alvaro Enriquez de Luna, Carlos Miravet, Deitze Otaduy, Carlos Dorronsoro","In this paper, a decision support system for ship identification is presented. The system receives as input a silhouette of the vessel to be identified, previously extracted from a side view of the object. This view could have been acquired with imaging sensors operating at different spectral ranges (CCD, FLIR, image intensifier). The input silhouette is preprocessed and compared to those stored in a database, retrieving a small number of potential matches ranked by their similarity to the target silhouette. This set of potential matches is presented to the system operator, who makes the final ship identification. This system makes use of an evolved version of the Curvature Scale Space (CSS) representation. In the proposed approach, it is curvature extrema, instead of zero crossings, that are tracked during silhouette evolution, hence improving robustness and enabling to cope successfully with cases where the standard CCS representation is found to be unstable. Also, the use of local curvature was replaced with the more robust concept of lobe concavity, with significant additional gains in performance. Experimental results on actual operational imagery prove the excellent performance and robustness of the developed method.",CV,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0510026v1.pdf

Starting from the extreme pixel values at both ends of the histogram plot, the algorithm is applied recursively on sub-ranges computed from the previous step, so as to find a threshold level and a new sub-range for the next step, until no significant improvement in image quality can be achieved. The method makes use of the fact that a number of distributions tend towards Dirac delta function, peaking at the mean, in the limiting condition of vanishing variance. The procedure naturally provides for variable size segmentation with bigger blocks near the extreme pixel values and finer divisions around the mean or other chosen value for better visualization.

The image continuity is taken care by choosing the threshold of the sub-image under consideration to lie within the above range.

This representation allows the comparison of two images and the computation of their similarity. The first step in this computation of similarity is the seach of a geometrical basis of the two dimensional space where the two images are represented simultaneously after transformation of one of them. Presently, this simultaneous representation takes into account a shift and a scaling ; it may be extended to rotations or other global geometrical transformations. An elementary probabilistic computation shows that a sufficient but not excessive number of trials (a few tens) ensures that the exhibition of this common basis is guaranteed in spite of possible errors in the detection of edges. When this first step is performed, the search of similarity between the two images reduces to counting the coincidence of edges in the two images.

The presented method attempts to remove the aliasing using frequency filters based on the discrete fast Fourier transform, and applied directionally in certain regions placed along the edges in the image.   As opposed to some anisotropic smoothing methods, the presented algorithm aims to selectively reduce only the aliasing, preserving the sharpness of image details.

0609100v1,Total Variation Minimization and Graph Cuts for Moving Objects   Segmentation,"Florent Ranchin, Antonin Chambolle, Françoise Dibos","In this paper, we are interested in the application to video segmentation of the discrete shape optimization problem involving the shape weighted perimeter and an additional term depending on a parameter. Based on recent works and in particular the one of Darbon and Sigelle, we justify the equivalence of the shape optimization problem and a weighted total variation regularization. For solving this problem, we adapt the projection algorithm proposed recently for solving the basic TV regularization problem. Another solution to the shape optimization investigated here is the graph cut technique. Both methods have the advantage to lead to a global minimum. Since we can distinguish moving objects from static elements of a scene by analyzing norm of the optical flow vectors, we choose the optical flow norm as initial data. In order to have the contour as close as possible to an edge in the image, we use a classical edge detector function as the weight of the weighted total variation. This model has been used in one of our former works. We also apply the same methods to a video segmentation model used by Jehan-Besson, Barlaud and Aubert. In this case, only standard perimeter is incorporated in the shape functional. We also propose another way for finding moving objects by using an a contrario detection of objects on the image obtained by solving the Rudin-Osher-Fatemi Total Variation regularization problem.We can notice the segmentation can be associated to a level set in the former methods.",CV,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0609100v1.pdf

0610059v2,Camera motion estimation through planar deformation determination,"Claire Jonchery, Françoise Dibos, Georges Koepfler","In this paper, we propose a global method for estimating the motion of a camera which films a static scene. Our approach is direct, fast and robust, and deals with adjacent frames of a sequence. It is based on a quadratic approximation of the deformation between two images, in the case of a scene with constant depth in the camera coordinate system. This condition is very restrictive but we show that provided translation and depth inverse variations are small enough, the error on optical flow involved by the approximation of depths by a constant is small. In this context, we propose a new model of camera motion, that allows to separate the image deformation in a similarity and a ``purely'' projective application, due to change of optical axis direction. This model leads to a quadratic approximation of image deformation that we estimate with an M-estimator; we can immediatly deduce camera motion parameters.",CV,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0610059v2.pdf
0611115v1,A higher-order active contour model of a `gas of circles' and its   application to tree crown extraction,"Peter Horvath, Ian Jermyn, Zoltan Kato, Josiane Zerubia","Many image processing problems involve identifying the region in the image domain occupied by a given entity in the scene. Automatic solution of these problems requires models that incorporate significant prior knowledge about the shape of the region. Many methods for including such knowledge run into difficulties when the topology of the region is unknown a priori, for example when the entity is composed of an unknown number of similar objects. Higher-order active contours (HOACs) represent one method for the modelling of non-trivial prior knowledge about shape without necessarily constraining region topology, via the inclusion of non-local interactions between region boundary points in the energy defining the model. The case of an unknown number of circular objects arises in a number of domains, e.g. medical, biological, nanotechnological, and remote sensing imagery. Regions composed of an a priori unknown number of circles may be referred to as a `gas of circles'. In this report, we present a HOAC model of a `gas of circles'. In order to guarantee stable circles, we conduct a stability analysis via a functional Taylor expansion of the HOAC energy around a circular shape. This analysis fixes one of the model parameters in terms of the others and constrains the rest. In conjunction with a suitable likelihood energy, we apply the model to the extraction of tree crowns from aerial imagery, and show that the new model outperforms other techniques.",CV,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0611115v1.pdf

0703053v1,Extraction of cartographic objects in high resolution satellite images   for object model generation,"Guray Erus, Nicolas Loménie","The aim of this study is to detect man-made cartographic objects in high-resolution satellite images. New generation satellites offer a sub-metric spatial resolution, in which it is possible (and necessary) to develop methods at object level rather than at pixel level, and to exploit structural features of objects. With this aim, a method to generate structural object models from manually segmented images has been developed. To generate the model from non-segmented images, extraction of the objects from the sample images is required. A hybrid method of extraction (both in terms of input sources and segmentation algorithms) is proposed: A region based segmentation is applied on a 10 meter resolution multi-spectral image. The result is used as marker in a ""marker-controlled watershed method using edges"" on a 2.5 meter resolution panchromatic image.

For all these tasks, a major step is document segmentation into text lines.

The localization procedure is achieved using a multi-stage, multi-resolution algorithm de-signed to reduce computational complexity and time. The algorithm initially identifies regions in the image most likely to contain the desired objects and then examines these regions at progressively increasing resolutions.

The purpose of this research is to reduce the noise and blur while maintaining image integrity for improved diagnosis. The proposed solution is to increase image quality after the standard pre- and post-processing undertaken by a gamma camera system. Mean Field Annealing (MFA) is the image processing technique used in this research. It is a computational iterative technique that makes use of the Point Spread Function (PSF) and the noise associated with the NM image. MFA is applied to NM images with the objective of reducing noise while not compromising edge integrity. Using a sharpening filter as a post-processing technique (after MFA) yields image enhancement of planar NM images.,CV,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0705.0828v1.pdf

If a video sequence or some training set other than the given low-resolution image is available, this kind of extra information can greatly aid in the reconstruction of the high-resolution image. The problem is substantially more difficult with only a single low-resolution image on hand. The image reconstruction methods designed primarily for denoising is insufficient for super-resolution problem in the sense that it tends to oversmooth images with essentially no noise. We propose a new adaptive linear interpolation method based on variational method and inspired by local linear embedding (LLE). The experimental result shows that our method avoids the problem of oversmoothing and preserves image structures well.",CV,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0709.1771v1.pdf

The bandwidth can be fixed for all the data set or can vary at each points. Automatic bandwidth selection becomes a real challenge in case of multidimensional heterogeneous features. This paper presents a solution to this problem. It is an extension of \cite{Comaniciu03a} which was based on the fundamental property of normal distributions regarding the bias of the normalized density gradient. The selection is done iteratively for each type of features, by looking for the stability of local bandwidth estimates across a predefined range of bandwidths. A pseudo balloon mean shift filtering and partitioning are introduced. The validity of the method is demonstrated in the context of color image segmentation based on a 5-dimensional space.",CV,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0709.1920v2.pdf
0709.3013v2,Supervised learning on graphs of spatio-temporal similarity in satellite   image sequences,"Patrick Héas, Mihai Datcu","High resolution satellite image sequences are multidimensional signals composed of spatio-temporal patterns associated to numerous and various phenomena. Bayesian methods have been previously proposed in (Heas and Datcu, 2005) to code the information contained in satellite image sequences in a graph representation using Bayesian methods. Based on such a representation, this paper further presents a supervised learning methodology of semantics associated to spatio-temporal patterns occurring in satellite image sequences. It enables the recognition and the probabilistic retrieval of similar events. Indeed, graphs are attached to statistical models for spatio-temporal processes, which at their turn describe physical changes in the observed scene. Therefore, we adjust a parametric model evaluating similarity types between graph patterns in order to represent user-specific semantics attached to spatio-temporal phenomena. The learning step is performed by the incremental definition of similarity types via user-provided spatio-temporal pattern examples attached to positive or/and negative semantics. From these examples, probabilities are inferred using a Bayesian network and a Dirichlet model. This enables to links user interest to a specific similarity model between graph patterns. According to the current state of learning, semantic posterior probabilities are updated for all possible graph patterns so that similar spatio-temporal phenomena can be recognized and retrieved from the image sequence. Few experiments performed on a multi-spectral SPOT image sequence illustrate the proposed spatio-temporal recognition method.",CV,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0709.3013v2.pdf
0710.0043v2,"Graph rigidity, Cyclic Belief Propagation and Point Pattern Matching","Julian J. McAuley, Tiberio S. Caetano, Marconi S. Barbosa","A recent paper \cite{CaeCaeSchBar06} proposed a provably optimal, polynomial time method for performing near-isometric point pattern matching by means of exact probabilistic inference in a chordal graphical model. Their fundamental result is that the chordal graph in question is shown to be globally rigid, implying that exact inference provides the same matching solution as exact inference in a complete graphical model. This implies that the algorithm is optimal when there is no noise in the point patterns. In this paper, we present a new graph which is also globally rigid but has an advantage over the graph proposed in \cite{CaeCaeSchBar06}: its maximal clique size is smaller, rendering inference significantly more efficient. However, our graph is not chordal and thus standard Junction Tree algorithms cannot be directly applied. Nevertheless, we show that loopy belief propagation in such a graph converges to the optimal solution. This allows us to retain the optimality guarantee in the noiseless case, while substantially reducing both memory requirements and processing time. Our experimental results show that the accuracy of the proposed solution is indistinguishable from that of \cite{CaeCaeSchBar06} when there is noise in the point patterns.",CV,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0710.0043v2.pdf

Unlike traditional gradient-based approaches, which may require many iterations to converge, our techniques achieve competitive results after only a few iterations. On the other hand, while belief-propagation techniques are often unable to deal with high-order models due to the explosion in the size of messages, we avoid this problem by approximating our high-order prior model using a Gaussian mixture. By using such an approximation, we are able to inpaint images quickly while at the same time retaining good visual results.",CV,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0710.0243v1.pdf

We show that despite the maturity of the field, different approaches still deliver results that vary enough to allow improvements by using their combination. We do so by choosing four well-motivated state-of-the-art recognition systems for which results on the standard MNIST benchmark are available. When comparing the errors made, we observe that the errors made differ between all four systems, suggesting the use of classifier combination. We then determine the error rate of a hypothetical system that combines the output of the four systems. The result obtained in this manner is an error rate of 0.35% on the MNIST data, the best result published so far.

0712.0136v1,Learning View Generalization Functions,Thomas M. Breuel,"Learning object models from views in 3D visual object recognition is usually formulated either as a function approximation problem of a function describing the view-manifold of an object, or as that of learning a class-conditional density. This paper describes an alternative framework for learning in visual object recognition, that of learning the view-generalization function. Using the view-generalization function, an observer can perform Bayes-optimal 3D object recognition given one or more 2D training views directly, without the need for a separate model acquisition step. The paper shows that view generalization functions can be computationally practical by restating two widely-used methods, the eigenspace and linear combination of views approaches, in a view generalization framework. The paper relates the approach to recent methods for object recognition based on non-uniform blurring. The paper presents results both on simulated 3D ``paperclip'' objects and real-world images from the COIL-100 database showing that useful view-generalization functions can be realistically be learned from a comparatively small number of training examples.",CV,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0712.0136v1.pdf

Furthermore, it demonstrates that such systems do not require more training views than Bayes-optimal 3D model-based systems. For building computer vision systems, these results imply that using view-based or appearance-based techniques with carefully constructed combination of evidence mechanisms may not be at a disadvantage relative to 3D model-based systems. For computational approaches to human vision, they show that it is impossible to distinguish view-based and 3D model-based techniques for 3D object recognition solely by comparing the performance achievable by human and 3D model-based systems.}",CV,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0712.0137v1.pdf
0712.1878v1,Hierarchy construction schemes within the Scale set framework,"Jean Hugues Pruvot, Luc Brun","Segmentation algorithms based on an energy minimisation framework often depend on a scale parameter which balances a fit to data and a regularising term. Irregular pyramids are defined as a stack of graphs successively reduced. Within this framework, the scale is often defined implicitly as the height in the pyramid. However, each level of an irregular pyramid can not usually be readily associated to the global optimum of an energy or a global criterion on the base level graph. This last drawback is addressed by the scale set framework designed by Guigues. The methods designed by this author allow to build a hierarchy and to design cuts within this hierarchy which globally minimise an energy. This paper studies the influence of the construction scheme of the initial hierarchy on the resulting optimal cuts. We propose one sequential and one parallel method with two variations within both. Our sequential methods provide partitions near the global optima while parallel methods require less execution times than the sequential method of Guigues even on sequential machines.",CV,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0712.1878v1.pdf

The method assumes that the text is written with a contrasting color on a more or less uniform background. But no assumption is made regarding the language or character set used to write the text. In particular, the text can contain simple graphics or symbols. The key feature of our approach is that we first concentrate on finding the background of the text, before testing whether there is actually text on the background. Since uniform areas are easy to find in natural images, and since text backgrounds define areas which contain ""holes"" (where the text is written) we thus look for uniform areas containing ""holes"" and label them as text backgrounds candidates. Each candidate area is then further tested for the presence of text within its convex hull. We tested our method on a database of 65 images including English and Urdu text.

While a dominant (additive, stationary) Gaussian noise component in image data will ensure that wavelet coefficients are of Gaussian distribution, long tailed distributions (symptomatic, for example, of extreme values) may well hold in practice for wavelet coefficients. Energy (2nd order moment) has often been used for image characterization for image content-based retrieval, and higher order moments may be important also, not least for capturing long tailed distributional behavior. In this work, we assess 2nd, 3rd and 4th order moments of multiresolution transform -- wavelet and curvelet transform -- coefficients as features.

Interaction is expressed in the model creation, which is done according to user traces drawn over a given input image. Both model and input are then represented by means of attributed relational graphs derived on the fly. Appearance features are taken into account as object attributes and structural properties are expressed as relational attributes. To cope with possible topological differences between both graphs, a new structure called the deformation graph is introduced. The segmentation process corresponds to finding a labelling of the input graph that minimizes the deformations introduced in the model when it is updated with input information. This approach has shown to be faster than other segmentation methods, with competitive output quality. Therefore, the method solves the problem of multiple label segmentation in an efficient way. Encouraging results on both natural and target-specific color images, as well as examples showing the reusability of the model, are presented and discussed.",CV,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0805.1854v2.pdf

Using shape derivation tools, our effort focuses on constructing a general expression for the derivative of the energy (with respect to a domain) and derive the corresponding evolution speed. A general result is stated within the framework of multi-parameter exponential family. More particularly, when using Maximum Likelihood estimators, the evolution speed has a closed-form expression that depends simply on the probability density function, while complicating additive terms appear when using other estimators, e.g. moments method. Experimental results on both synthesized and real images demonstrate the applicability of our approach.",CV,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0805.3217v1.pdf

On the one hand, we use the general framework of exponential family as a prior model for noise. On the other hand, translation and scale invariant Legendre moments are considered to incorporate the shape prior (e.g. fidelity to a reference shape). The combination of the two prior terms in the active contour functional yields the final evolution equation whose evolution speed is rigorously derived using shape derivative tools.

There are many genomic and proteomic applications which rely on feature selection to answer questions such as: selecting signature genes which are informative about some biological state, e.g. normal tissues and several types of cancer; or defining a network of prediction or inference among elements such as genes, proteins, external stimuli and other elements of interest. In these applications, a recurrent problem is the lack of samples to perform an adequate estimate of the joint probabilities between element states. A myriad of feature selection algorithms and criterion functions are proposed, although it is difficult to point the best solution in general. The intent of this work is to provide an open-source multiplataform graphical environment to apply, test and compare many feature selection approaches suitable to be used in bioinformatics problems.",CV,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0805.3964v2.pdf
0806.0689v1,Directional Cross Diamond Search Algorithm for Fast Block Motion   Estimation,"Hongjun Jia, Li Zhang","In block-matching motion estimation (BMME), the search patterns have a significant impact on the algorithm's performance, both the search speed and the search quality. The search pattern should be designed to fit the motion vector probability (MVP) distribution characteristics of the real-world sequences. In this paper, we build a directional model of MVP distribution to describe the directional-center-biased characteristic of the MVP distribution and the directional characteristics of the conditional MVP distribution more exactly based on the detailed statistical data of motion vectors of eighteen popular sequences. Three directional search patterns are firstly designed by utilizing the directional characteristics and they are the smallest search patterns among the popular ones. A new algorithm is proposed using the horizontal cross search pattern as the initial step and the horizontal/vertical diamond search pattern as the subsequent step for the fast BMME, which is called the directional cross diamond search (DCDS) algorithm. The DCDS algorithm can obtain the motion vector with fewer search points than CDS, DS or HEXBS while maintaining the similar or even better search quality. The gain on speedup of DCDS over CDS or DS can be up to 54.9%. The simulation results show that DCDS is efficient, effective and robust, and it can always give the faster search speed on different sequences than other fast block-matching algorithm in common use.",CV,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0806.0689v1.pdf

Krim","We propose a robust classification algorithm for curves in 2D and 3D, under the special and full groups of affine transformations. To each plane or spatial curve we assign a plane signature curve. Curves, equivalent under an affine transformation, have the same signature. The signatures introduced in this paper are based on integral invariants, which behave much better on noisy images than classically known differential invariants. The comparison with other types of invariants is given in the introduction. Though the integral invariants for planar curves were known before, the affine integral invariants for spatial curves are proposed here for the first time. Using the inductive variation of the moving frame method we compute affine invariants in terms of Euclidean invariants. We present two types of signatures, the global signature and the local signature. Both signatures are independent of parameterization (curve sampling). The global signature depends on the choice of the initial point and does not allow us to compare fragments of curves, and is therefore sensitive to occlusions. The local signature, although is slightly more sensitive to noise, is independent of the choice of the initial point and is not sensitive to occlusions in an image. It helps establish local equivalence of curves. The robustness of these invariants and signatures in their application to the problem of classification of noisy spatial curves extracted from a 3D object is analyzed.",CV,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0806.1984v1.pdf

Part   4: Simple, generic and robust extraction of grains in granular materials   obtained by X-ray tomography",Vincent Tariel,"This paper proposes a simple, generic and robust method to extract the grains from experimental tridimensionnal images of granular materials obtained by X-ray tomography. This extraction has two steps: segmentation and splitting. For the segmentation step, if there is a sufficient contrast between the different components, a classical threshold procedure followed by a succession of morphological filters can be applied. If not, and if the boundary needs to be localized precisely, a watershed transformation controlled by labels is applied. The basement of this transformation is to localize a label included in the component and another label in the component complementary. A ""soft"" threshold following by an opening is applied on the initial image to localize a label in a component. For any segmentation procedure, the visualisation shows a problem: some groups of two grains, close one to each other, become connected. So if a classical cluster procedure is applied on the segmented binary image, these numerical connected grains are considered as a single grain. To overcome this problem, we applied a procedure introduced by L. Vincent in 1993. This grains extraction is tested for various complexes porous media and granular material, to predict various properties (diffusion, electrical conductivity, deformation field) in a good agreement with experiment data.",CV,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0806.3939v2.pdf

However, scholarly articles frequently report important findings in figures for visual impact and the contents of these figures are not indexed. These contents are often invaluable to the researcher in various fields, for the purposes of direct comparison with their own work. Therefore, searching for figures and extracting figure data are important problems. To the best of our knowledge, there exists no tool to automatically extract data from figures in digital documents. If we can extract data from these images automatically and store them in a database, an end-user can query and combine data from multiple digital documents simultaneously and efficiently. We propose a framework based on image analysis and machine learning to extract information from 2-D plot images and store them in a database.

Since the most common distortion can be modelled as radial distortion, we illustrate the method using the Harris radial distortion model, but the method is applicable to any distortion model. The method is based on transforming the edgels of the distorted image to a 1-D angular Hough space, and optimizing the distortion correction parameters which minimize the entropy of the corresponding normalized histogram. Properly corrected imagery will have fewer curved lines, and therefore less spread in Hough space. Since the method does not rely on any image structure beyond the existence of edgels sharing some common orientations and does not use edge fitting, it is applicable to a wide variety of image types. For instance, it can be applied equally well to images of texture with weak but dominant orientations, or images with strong vanishing points. Finally, the method is performed on both synthetic and real data revealing that it is particularly robust to noise.",CV,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0810.4426v2.pdf

We propose to take advantage of this manifold structure for the effective classification of the object represented by the observation set. In particular, we design a low complexity solution that is able to exploit the properties of the data manifolds with a graph-based algorithm. Hence, we formulate the computation of the unknown label matrix as a smoothing process on the manifold under the constraint that all observations represent an object of one single class. It results into a discrete optimization problem, which can be solved by an efficient and low complexity algorithm. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed graph-based algorithm in the classification of sets of multiple images. Moreover, we show its high potential in video-based face recognition, where it outperforms state-of-the-art solutions that fall short of exploiting the manifold structure of the face image data sets.",CV,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0810.4617v2.pdf

Next, we implement a dimensionality reduction process with simultaneous sparse approximations and subspace projection. It permits to represent each 3D face by only a few spherical functions that are able to capture the salient facial characteristics, and hence to preserve the discriminant facial information. We eventually perform recognition by effective matching in the reduced space, where Linear Discriminant Analysis can be further activated for improved recognition performance.

0901.4953v1,A Keygraph Classification Framework for Real-Time Object Detection,"Marcelo Hashimoto, Roberto M. Cesar Jr","In this paper, we propose a new approach for keypoint-based object detection. Traditional keypoint-based methods consist in classifying individual points and using pose estimation to discard misclassifications. Since a single point carries no relational features, such methods inherently restrict the usage of structural information to the pose estimation phase. Therefore, the classifier considers purely appearance-based feature vectors, thus requiring computationally expensive feature extraction or complex probabilistic modelling to achieve satisfactory robustness. In contrast, our approach consists in classifying graphs of keypoints, which incorporates structural information during the classification phase and allows the extraction of simpler feature vectors that are naturally robust. In the present work, 3-vertices graphs have been considered, though the methodology is general and larger order graphs may be adopted.

The goal of point set registration is to assign correspondences between two sets of points and to recover the transformation that maps one point set to the other. Multiple factors, including an unknown non-rigid spatial transformation, large dimensionality of point set, noise and outliers, make the point set registration a challenging problem. We introduce a probabilistic method, called the Coherent Point Drift (CPD) algorithm, for both rigid and non-rigid point set registration. We consider the alignment of two point sets as a probability density estimation problem. We fit the GMM centroids (representing the first point set) to the data (the second point set) by maximizing the likelihood. We force the GMM centroids to move coherently as a group to preserve the topological structure of the point sets. In the rigid case, we impose the coherence constraint by re-parametrization of GMM centroid locations with rigid parameters and derive a closed form solution of the maximization step of the EM algorithm in arbitrary dimensions. In the non-rigid case, we impose the coherence constraint by regularizing the displacement field and using the variational calculus to derive the optimal transformation. We also introduce a fast algorithm that reduces the method computation complexity to linear. We test the CPD algorithm for both rigid and non-rigid transformations in the presence of noise, outliers and missing points, where CPD shows accurate results and outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.",CV,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0905.2635v1.pdf

Then, as we gradually broaden the family of hypothesis where color is learned, we let our demosaicing behave adaptively, in a manner that reflects our prior knowledge about the statistics of color images.

The proposed model also automatically changes its topology and remains fully compatible with the general framework of deformable models. More precisely, the image space is equipped with a metric that expands salient image details according to their strength and their curvature. During the whole evolution of the model, the sampling of the contour is kept regular with respect to this metric. By this way, the vertex density is reduced along most parts of the curve while a high quality of shape representation is preserved. The complexity of the deformable model is thus improved and is no longer influenced by feature-preserving changes in the resolution of input images. Building the metric requires a prior estimation of contour curvature. It is obtained using a robust estimator which investigates the local variations in the orientation of image gradient.

On the other hand maintaining the rate of production with respect to time is also a major issue in ceramic tile manufacturing. Again, price of ceramic tiles also depends on purity of texture, accuracy of color, shape etc. Considering this criteria, an automated defect detection and classification technique has been proposed in this report that can have ensured the better quality of tiles in manufacturing process as well as production rate. Our proposed method plays an important role in ceramic tiles industries to detect the defects and to control the quality of ceramic tiles. This automated classification method helps us to acquire knowledge about the pattern of defect within a very short period of time and also to decide about the recovery process so that the defected tiles may not be mixed with the fresh tiles.",CV,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0906.3770v1.pdf
0906.4131v2,Automatic Spatially-Adaptive Balancing of Energy Terms for Image   Segmentation,"Josna Rao, Ghassan Hamarneh, Rafeef Abugharbieh","Image segmentation techniques are predominately based on parameter-laden optimization. The objective function typically involves weights for balancing competing image fidelity and segmentation regularization cost terms. Setting these weights suitably has been a painstaking, empirical process. Even if such ideal weights are found for a novel image, most current approaches fix the weight across the whole image domain, ignoring the spatially-varying properties of object shape and image appearance. We propose a novel technique that autonomously balances these terms in a spatially-adaptive manner through the incorporation of image reliability in a graph-based segmentation framework. We validate on synthetic data achieving a reduction in mean error of 47% (p-value << 0.05) when compared to the best fixed parameter segmentation. We also present results on medical images (including segmentations of the corpus callosum and brain tissue in MRI data) and on natural images.",CV,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0906.4131v2.pdf
0906.4789v1,Efficient IRIS Recognition through Improvement of Feature Extraction and   subset Selection,"Amir Azizi, Hamid Reza Pourreza",The selection of the optimal feature subset and the classification has become an important issue in the field of iris recognition. In this paper we propose several methods for iris feature subset selection and vector creation. The deterministic feature sequence is extracted from the iris image by using the contourlet transform technique. Contourlet transform captures the intrinsic geometrical structures of iris image. It decomposes the iris image into a set of directional sub-bands with texture details captured in different orientations at various scales so for reducing the feature vector dimensions we use the method for extract only significant bit and information from normalized iris images. In this method we ignore fragile bits. And finally we use SVM (Support Vector Machine) classifier for approximating the amount of people identification in our proposed system. Experimental result show that most proposed method reduces processing time and increase the classification accuracy and also the iris feature vector length is much smaller versus the other methods.,CV,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0906.4789v1.pdf

1806.01198v1,Novel Approach for Cybersecurity Workforce Development: A Course in   Secure Design,"Filipo Sharevski, Adam Trowbridge, Jessica Westbrook","Training the future cybersecurity workforce to respond to emerging threats requires introduction of novel educational interventions into the cybersecurity curriculum. To be effective, these interventions have to incorporate trending knowledge from cybersecurity and other related domains while allowing for experiential learning through hands-on experimentation. To date, the traditional interdisciplinary approach for cybersecurity training has infused political science, law, economics or linguistics knowledge into the cybersecurity curriculum, allowing for limited experimentation. Cybersecurity students were left with little opportunity to acquire knowledge, skills, and abilities in domains outside of these. Also, students in outside majors had no options to get into cybersecurity. With this in mind, we developed an interdisciplinary course for experiential learning in the fields of cybersecurity and interaction design. The inaugural course teaches students from cybersecurity, user interaction design, and visual design the principles of designing for secure use - or secure design - and allows them to apply them for prototyping of Internet-of-Things (IoT) products for smart homes. This paper elaborates on the concepts of secure design and how our approach enhances the training of the future cybersecurity workforce.",Cybersecurity,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.01198v1.pdf

The Cybersecurity Resilience and Law Enforcement Collaboration (CyRLEC) Framework is designed to provide a comprehensive and integrated approach to cybersecurity that emphasizes collaboration with law enforcement agencies to mitigate cyber threats. The paper compares and contrasts the CyRLEC Framework with the NIST Cybersecurity Framework and highlights the critical differences between the two frameworks. While the NIST framework focuses on managing cybersecurity risk, the CyRLEC Framework takes a broader view of cybersecurity, including proactive prevention, early detection, rapid response to cyber-attacks, and close collaboration with law enforcement agencies to investigate and prosecute cybercriminals. The paper also provides a case study of a simulated real-world implementation of the CyRLEC Framework and evaluates its effectiveness in improving an organization's cybersecurity posture. The research findings demonstrate the value of the CyRLEC Framework in enhancing cybersecurity resilience and promoting effective collaboration with law enforcement agencies. Overall, this research paper contributes to the growing knowledge of cybersecurity frameworks and provides practical insights for organizations seeking to improve their cybersecurity posture.",Cybersecurity,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.10874v1.pdf

To this end, a pilot study was first conducted to measure the current level of cybersecurity awareness. The results revealed that students do not have much knowledge of Cybersecurity. Thus, a four-step approach was proposed to infuse the relevant cybersecurity topics in five matched courses based on the latest Cybersecurity curricular guidelines (CSEC2017). A sample of 42 students was selected purposively without prior knowledge of Cybersecurity and divided identically into experimental and control groups. Students in the experimental group were asked to take five consecutive courses over five semesters. In each course, groups went through a pre-test for the infused topics. Then, the experimental group taught the corresponding infused topics. A post-test was administered to both groups at the end of each course, and the t-test was conducted. The results found significant differences between marks of prior and post-tests for 11 out of 14 infused topics.

2311.10165v1,Practical Cybersecurity Ethics: Mapping CyBOK to Ethical Concerns,"Ivan Flechais, George Chalhoub","Research into the ethics of cybersecurity is an established and growing topic of investigation, however the translation of this research into practice is lacking: there exists a small number of professional codes of ethics or codes of practice in cybersecurity, however these are very broad and do not offer much insight into the ethical dilemmas that can be faced while performing specific cybersecurity activities. In order to address this gap, we leverage ongoing work on the Cyber Security Body of Knowledge (CyBOK) to help elicit and document the responsibilities and ethics of the profession. Based on a literature review of the ethics of cybersecurity, we use CyBOK to frame the exploration of ethical challenges in the cybersecurity profession through a series of 15 interviews with cybersecurity experts. Our approach is qualitative and exploratory, aiming to answer the research question ""What ethical challenges, insights, and solutions arise in different areas of cybersecurity?"". Our findings indicate that there are broad ethical challenges across the whole of cybersecurity, but also that different areas of cybersecurity can face specific ethical considerations for which more detailed guidance can help professionals in those areas. In particular, our findings indicate that security decision-making is expected of all security professionals, but that this requires them to balance a complex mix of technical, objective and subjective points of view, and that resolving conflicts raises challenging ethical dilemmas. We conclude that more work is needed to explore, map, and integrate ethical considerations into cybersecurity practice; the urgent need to conduct further research into the ethics of cybersecurity AI; and highlight the importance of this work for individuals and professional bodies who seek to develop and mature the cybersecurity profession in a responsible manner.",Cybersecurity,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.10165v1.pdf

These companies are large in number and often do not have the controls in place to prevent successful attacks, respectively are not prepared to systematically manage their cybersecurity capabilities. One of the reasons for why many SME do not adopt cybersecurity is that developers of cybersecurity solutions understand little the SME context and the requirements for successful use of these solutions. We elicit requirements by studying how cybersecurity experts provide advice to SME. The experts recommendations offer insights into what important capabilities of the solution are and how these capabilities ought to be used for mitigating cybersecurity threats. The adoption of a recommendation hints at a correct match of the solution, hence successful consideration of requirements. Abandoned recommendations point to a misalignment that can be used as a source to inquire missed requirements. Re-occurrence of adoption or abandonment decisions corroborate the presence of requirements.

2308.06963v1,The Future of Cybersecurity in Southeast Asia along the Maritime Silk   Road,Roberto Dillon,"This paper proposes an analysis of the prospects of the cyber security industry and educational ecosystems in four Southeast Asian countries, namely Vietnam, Singapore, Malaysia, and Indonesia, which are along the Maritime Silk Road, by using two novel metrics: the ""Cybersecurity Education Prospects Index"" (CEPI) and the ""Cybersecurity Industry Prospects Index"" (CIPI). The CEPI evaluates the state of cybersecurity education by assessing the availability and quality of cybersecurity degrees together with their ability to attract new students. On the other hand, the CIPI measures the potential for the cybersecurity industry's growth and development by assessing the talent pool needed to build and sustain its growth. Ultimately, this study emphasizes the vital importance of a healthy cybersecurity ecosystem where education is responsible for supporting the industry to ensure the security and reliability of commercial operations in these countries against a complex and evolving cyber threat landscape.",Cybersecurity,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.06963v1.pdf
2309.17186v1,"Unaware, Unfunded and Uneducated: A Systematic Review of SME   Cybersecurity","Carlos Rombaldo Junior, Ingolf Becker, Shane Johnson","Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) are pivotal in the global economy, accounting for over 90% of businesses and 60% of employment worldwide. Despite their significance, SMEs have been disregarded from cybersecurity initiatives, rendering them ill-equipped to deal with the growing frequency, sophistication, and destructiveness of cyber-attacks. We systematically reviewed the cybersecurity literature on SMEs published between 2017 and 2023.   We focus on research discussing cyber threats, adopted controls, challenges, and constraints SMEs face in pursuing cybersecurity resilience.   Our search yielded 916 studies that we narrowed to 77 relevant papers. We identified 44 unique themes and categorised them as novel findings or established knowledge. This distinction revealed that research on SMEs is shallow and has made little progress in understanding SMEs' roles, threats, and needs. Studies often repeated early discoveries without replicating or offering new insights.   The existing research indicates that the main challenges to attaining cybersecurity resilience of SMEs are a lack of awareness of the cybersecurity risks, limited cybersecurity literacy and constrained financial resources. However, resource availability varied between developed and developing countries. Our analysis indicated a relationship among these themes, suggesting that limited literacy is the root cause of awareness and resource constraint issues.",Cybersecurity,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.17186v1.pdf
2311.17578v1,Data Driven Approaches to Cybersecurity Governance for Board   Decision-Making -- A Systematic Review,"Anita Modi, Ievgeniia Kuzminykh, Bogdan Ghita","Cybersecurity governance influences the quality of strategic decision-making to ensure cyber risks are managed effectively. Board of Directors are the decisions-makers held accountable for managing this risk; however, they lack adequate and efficient information necessary for making such decisions. In addition to the myriad of challenges they face, they are often insufficiently versed in the technology or cybersecurity terminology or not provided with the correct tools to support them to make sound decisions to govern cybersecurity effectively. A different approach is needed to ensure BoDs are clear on the approach the business is taking to build a cyber resilient organization. This systematic literature review investigates the existing risk measurement instruments, cybersecurity metrics, and associated models for supporting BoDs. We identified seven conceptual themes through literature analysis that form the basis of this study's main contribution. The findings showed that, although sophisticated cybersecurity tools exist and are developing, there is limited information for Board of Directors to support them in terms of metrics and models to govern cybersecurity in a language they understand. The review also provides some recommendations on theories and models that can be further investigated to provide support to Board of Directors.",Cybersecurity,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.17578v1.pdf

We are presented with a unique but quickly waning opportunity to bring cybersecurity concerns to the forefront for quantum information systems before they become widely deployed. The resources and knowledge required to do so, however, may not be common in the cybersecurity community. Yet, a nexus exist. Cybersecurity starts with risk, and there are good taxonomies for security vulnerabilities and impacts in classical systems. In this paper, we propose a preliminary taxonomy for quantum cybersecurity vulnerabilities that accounts for the latest advances in quantum information systems, and must evolve to incorporate well-established cybersecurity principles and methodologies. We envision a testbed environment designed and instrumented with the specific purpose of enabling a broad collaborative community of cybersecurity and quantum information system experts to conduct experimental evaluation of software and hardware security including both physical and virtual quantum components.

2408.05895v1,Gender of Recruiter Makes a Difference: A study into Cybersecurity   Graduate Recruitment,"Joanne L. Hall, Asha Rao","An ever-widening workforce gap exists in the global cybersecurity industry but diverse talent is underutilized. The global cybersecurity workforce is only 25% female. Much research exists on the effect of gender bias on the hiring of women into the technical workforce, but little on how the gender of the recruiter (gender difference) affects recruitment decisions. This research reveals differences between the non-technical skills sought by female vs non-female cybersecurity recruiters. The former look for recruits with people-focused skills while the latter look for task-focused skills, highlighting the need for gender diversity in recruitment panels.   Recruiters are increasingly seeking non-technical (soft) skills in technical graduate recruits. This requires STEM curriculum in Universities to adapt to match. Designing an industry-ready cybersecurity curriculum requires knowledge of these non-technical skills. An online survey of cybersecurity professionals was used to determine the most sought after non-technical skills in the field. Analysis of the data reveals distinct gender differences in the non-technical skills most valued in a recruit, based on the gender of the recruiter (not the recruited). The gender differences discovered do not correspond to the higher proportion of women employed in non-technical cybersecurity roles.",Cybersecurity,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.05895v1.pdf
2408.16140v1,SoK: Identifying Limitations and Bridging Gaps of Cybersecurity   Capability Maturity Models (CCMMs),"Lasini Liyanage, Nalin Asanka Gamagedara Arachchilage, Giovanni Russello","In the rapidly evolving digital landscape, where organisations are increasingly vulnerable to cybersecurity threats, Cybersecurity Capability Maturity Models (CCMMs) emerge as pivotal tools in enhancing organisational cybersecurity posture. CCMMs provide a structured framework to guide organisations in assessing their current cybersecurity capabilities, identifying critical gaps, and prioritising improvements. However, the full potential of CCMMs is often not realised due to inherent limitations within the models and challenges encountered during their implementation and adoption processes. These limitations and challenges can significantly hamper the efficacy of CCMMs in improving cybersecurity. As a result, organisations remain vulnerable to cyber threats as they may fail to identify and address critical security gaps, implement necessary improvements or allocate resources effectively. To address these limitations and challenges, conducting a thorough investigation into existing models is essential. Therefore, we conducted a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) analysing 43 publications to identify existing CCMMs, their limitations, and the challenges organisations face when implementing and adopting them. By understanding these barriers, we aim to explore avenues for enhancing the efficacy of CCMMs, ensuring they more effectively meet the cybersecurity needs of organisational entities.",Cybersecurity,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.16140v1.pdf

Hastings","This study investigates the prevalence and underlying causes of work-related stress and burnout among cybersecurity professionals using a quantitative survey approach guided by the Job Demands-Resources model. Analysis of responses from 50 cybersecurity practitioners reveals an alarming reality: 44% report experiencing severe work-related stress and burnout, while an additional 28% are uncertain about their condition. The demanding nature of cybersecurity roles, unrealistic expectations, and unsupportive organizational cultures emerge as primary factors fueling this crisis. Notably, 66% of respondents perceive cybersecurity jobs as more stressful than other IT positions, with 84% facing additional challenges due to the pandemic and recent high-profile breaches. The study finds that most cybersecurity experts are reluctant to report their struggles to management, perpetuating a cycle of silence and neglect. To address this critical issue, the paper recommends that organizations foster supportive work environments, implement mindfulness programs, and address systemic challenges. By prioritizing the mental health of cybersecurity professionals, organizations can cultivate a more resilient and effective workforce to protect against an ever-evolving threat landscape.",Cybersecurity,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.12047v1.pdf

Computing societies and professional associations have recognized cybersecurity as a distinctive computing discipline and created specialized cybersecurity curricular guidelines. Higher education institutions are introducing new cybersecurity programs, attracting students to this expanding field. In this paper, we examined 101 study programs across 24 countries. Based on their analysis, we argue that top-ranked universities have not yet fully implemented the guidelines and offer programs that have ""cyber"" in their name but lack some essential elements of a cybersecurity program. In particular, most programs do not sufficiently cover non-technical components, such as law, policies, or risk management. Also, most programs teach knowledge and skills but do not expose students to experiential learning outside the traditional classroom (such as internships) to develop their competencies. As a result, graduates of these programs may not meet employer expectations and may require additional training. To help program directors and educators improve their programs and courses, this paper offers examples of effective practices from cybersecurity programs around the world and our teaching practice.",Cybersecurity,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.09240v1.pdf

Increased connection and automation have revolutionized the world's economic and cultural infrastructures, while they have introduced risks in terms of cyber attacks. CTI is information that helps cybersecurity analysts make intelligent security decisions, that is often delivered in the form of natural language text, which must be transformed to machine readable format through an automated procedure before it can be used for automated security measures.   This paper proposes SecureBERT, a cybersecurity language model capable of capturing text connotations in cybersecurity text (e.g., CTI) and therefore successful in automation for many critical cybersecurity tasks that would otherwise rely on human expertise and time-consuming manual efforts. SecureBERT has been trained using a large corpus of cybersecurity text.To make SecureBERT effective not just in retaining general English understanding, but also when applied to text with cybersecurity implications, we developed a customized tokenizer as well as a method to alter pre-trained weights. The SecureBERT is evaluated using the standard Masked Language Model (MLM) test as well as two additional standard NLP tasks. Our evaluation studies show that SecureBERT\footnote{\url{https://github.com/ehsanaghaei/SecureBERT}} outperforms existing similar models, confirming its capability for solving crucial NLP tasks in cybersecurity.",Cybersecurity,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.02685v3.pdf

2405.10373v1,A Transdisciplinary Approach to Cybersecurity: A Framework for   Encouraging Transdisciplinary Thinking,Emily Kesler,"Classical cybersecurity is often perceived as a rigid science discipline filled with computer scientists and mathematicians. However, due to the rapid pace of technology development and integration, new criminal enterprises, new defense tactics, and the understanding of the human element, cybersecurity is quickly beginning to encompass more than just computers. Cybersecurity experts must broaden their perspectives beyond traditional disciplinary boundaries to provide the best protection possible. They must start to practice transdisciplinary cybersecurity. Taking influence from the Stakeholder Theory in business ethics, this paper presents a framework to encourage transdisciplinary thinking and assist experts in tackling the new challenges of the modern day. The framework uses the simple Think, Plan, Do approach to enable experts to develop their transdisciplinary thinking. The framework is intended to be used as an evaluation tool for existing cybersecurity practices or postures, as a development tool to engage with other disciplines to foster learning and create new methods, and as a guidance tool to encourage new ways of thinking about, perceiving, and executing cybersecurity practices. For each of those intended uses, a use case is presented as an example to showcase how the framework might be used. The ultimate goal of this paper is not the framework but transdisciplinary thinking. By using the tool presented here and developing their own transdisciplinary thinking, cybersecurity experts can be better prepared to face cybersecurity's unique and complex challenges.",Cybersecurity,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.10373v1.pdf

2007.07602v2,Automating the Communication of Cybersecurity Knowledge: Multi-Case   Study,"Alireza Shojaifar, Samuel A. Fricker, Martin Gwerder","Cybersecurity is essential for the protection of companies against cyber threats. Traditionally, cybersecurity experts assess and improve a company's capabilities. However, many small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) consider such services not to be affordable. We explore an alternative do-it-yourself (DIY) approach to bringing cybersecurity to SMBs. Our method and tool, CYSEC, implements the Self-Determination Theory (SDT) to guide and motivate SMBs to adopt good cybersecurity practices. CYSEC uses assessment questions and recommendations to communicate cybersecurity knowledge to the end-user SMBs and encourage self-motivated change. In this paper, the operationalisation of SDT in CYSEC is presented and the results of a multi-case study shown that offer insight into how SMBs adopted cybersecurity practices with CYSEC. Effective automated cybersecurity communication depended on the SMB's hands-on skills, tools adaptedness, and the users' willingness to documenting confidential information. The SMBs wanted to learn in simple, incremental steps, allowing them to understand what they do. An SMB's motivation to improve security depended on the fitness of assessment questions and recommendations with the SMB's business model and IT infrastructure. The results of this study indicate that automated counselling can help many SMBs in security adoption.

2303.13621v1,A Novel Approach to the Behavioral Aspects of Cybersecurity,Sarah Sharifi,"The Internet and cyberspace are inseparable aspects of everyone's life. Cyberspace is a concept that describes widespread, interconnected, and online digital technology. Cyberspace refers to the online world that is separate from everyday reality. Since the internet is a recent advance in human lives, there are many unknown and unpredictable aspects to it that sometimes can be catastrophic to users in financial aspects, high-tech industry, and healthcare. Cybersecurity failures are usually caused by human errors or their lack of knowledge. According to the International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) X-Force Threat Intelligence Index in 2020, around 8.5 billion records were compromised in 2019 due to failures of insiders, which is an increase of more than 200 percent compared to the compromised records in 2018. In another survey performed by the Ernst and Young Global Information Security during 2018-2019, it is reported that 34% of the organizations stated that employees who are inattentive or do not have the necessary knowledge are the principal vulnerabilities of cybersecurity, and 22% of the organizations indicated that phishing is the main threat to them. Inattentive users are one of the reasons for data breaches and cyberattacks. The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) in the United Kingdom observed that 23.2 million users who were victims of cybersecurity attacks used a carelessly selected password, which is 123456, as their account password. The Annual Cybersecurity Report published by Cisco in 2018 announced that phishing and spear phishing emails are the root causes of many cybersecurity attacks in recent years. Hence, enhancing the cybersecurity behaviors of both personal users and organizations can protect vulnerable users from cyber threats. Both human factors and technological aspects of cybersecurity should be addressed in organizations for a safer environment.",Cybersecurity,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.13621v1.pdf

With a constantly changing threat landscape, practical solutions such as best-practices are employed, but the number of critical cybersecurity-related incidents remains high. To address these concerns, the National Cyber Security Centre published a Cybersecurity Body of Knowledge (CyBOK) to provide a comprehensive information base used to advise and underpin cybersecurity learning. Unfortunately, CyBOK contains over 1000 pages of in-depth material and may not be easy to navigate for novice individuals. Furthermore, it does not allow for easy expression of various cybersecurity scenarios that such individuals may be exposed to. As a solution to these two issues, we propose the use of a playing cards format to provide introductory cybersecurity knowledge that supports learning and discussion, using CyBOK as the foundation for the technical content. Upon evaluation in two user studies, we found that 80% of the participants agreed the cards provided them with introductory knowledge of cybersecurity topics, and 70% agreed the cards provided an interface for discussing topics and enabled them to make links between attacks, vulnerabilities and defences.",Cybersecurity,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.16535v1.pdf

Therefore, evaluating their performance is crucial for investors and policymakers. This work presents a financial evaluation of early-stage firms' performance in 19 cybersecurity sectors using a private-equity dataset from 2010 to 2022 retrieved from Crunchbase. We observe firms, their primary and secondary activities, funding rounds, and pre and post-money valuations. We compare cybersecurity sectors regarding the amount raised over funding rounds and post-money valuations while inferring missing observations. We observe significant investor interest variations across categories, periods, and locations. In particular, we find the average capital raised (valuations) to range from USD 7.24 mln (USD 32.39 mln) for spam filtering to USD 45.46 mln (USD 447.22 mln) for the private cloud sector. Next, we assume a log process for returns computed from post-money valuations and estimate the expected returns, systematic and specific risks, and risk-adjusted returns of investments in early-stage firms belonging to cybersecurity sectors. Again, we observe substantial performance variations with annualized expected returns ranging from 9.72\% for privacy to 177.27\% for the blockchain sector. Finally, we show that overall, the cybersecurity industry performance is on par with previous results found in private equity. Our results shed light on the performance of cybersecurity investments and, thus, on investors' expectations about cybersecurity.",Cybersecurity,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.04765v2.pdf

Although there is ample literature focusing on why people pose a major risk to organizational cybersecurity and how to deal with it, there is surprisingly little we know about cyber and information security decision-makers who are essentially the people in charge of setting up and maintaining organizational cybersecurity. In this paper, we study cybersecurity awareness of cyber and information security decision-makers, and investigate factors associated with it. We conducted an online survey among Slovenian cyber and information security decision-makers (N=283) to (1) determine whether their cybersecurity awareness is associated with adoption of antimalware solutions in their organizations, and (2) explore which organizational factors and personal characteristics are associated with their cybersecurity awareness. Our findings indicate that awareness of well-known threats and solutions seems to be quite low for individuals in decision-making roles. They also provide insights into which threats and solutions are cyber and information security decision-makers the least aware of. We uncovered that awareness of certain threats and solutions is positively associated with either adoption of advanced antimalware solutions with EDR/XDR capabilities or adoption of SOC. Additionally, we identified significant organizational factors (organizational role type) and personal characteristics (gender, age, experience with information security and experience with IT) related to cybersecurity awareness of cyber and information security decision-makers. Organization size and formal education were not significant. These results offer insights that can be leveraged in targeted cybersecurity training tailored to the needs of groups of cyber and information security decision-makers based on these key factors.",Cybersecurity,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.04725v1.pdf

Specifically, we create a high-quality bilingual instruction corpus by crawling cybersecurity raw text from cybersecurity websites to overcome the lack of effective data for information extraction. Then, we design a pipeline to auto-select tasks from the tasks pool and convert the raw text into supervised corpora comprised of question and response. The instruction dataset SEvenLLM-Instruct is used to train cybersecurity LLMs with the multi-task learning objective (27 well-designed tasks) for augmenting the analysis of cybersecurity events.

However, they face challenges in detecting novel threats. To address this issue, emerging cybersecurity systems are incorporating AI techniques, specifically deep-learning algorithms, to enhance their ability to detect incidents, analyze alerts, and respond to events. While these techniques offer a promising approach to combating dynamic security threats, they often require significant computational resources. Therefore, frameworks that incorporate AI-based cybersecurity mechanisms need to support the use of GPUs to ensure optimal performance.   Many cybersecurity framework vendors do not provide sufficiently detailed information about their implementation, making it difficult to assess the techniques employed and their effectiveness. This study aims to overcome this limitation by providing an overview of the most used cybersecurity frameworks that utilize AI techniques, specifically focusing on frameworks that provide comprehensive information about their implementation. Our primary objective is to identify the deep-learning techniques employed by these frameworks and evaluate their support for GPU acceleration. We have identified a total of \emph{two} deep-learning algorithms that are utilized by \emph{three} out of 38 selected cybersecurity frameworks. Our findings aim to assist in selecting open-source cybersecurity frameworks for future research and assessing any discrepancies between deep-learning techniques used in theory and practice.",Cybersecurity,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.12648v1.pdf

The amount of background knowledge they have about the evolving and new attacks makes a significant difference in their ability to detect attacks. Open source threat intelligence sources, like text descriptions about cyber-attacks, can be stored in a structured fashion in a cybersecurity knowledge graph. A cybersecurity knowledge graph can be paramount in aiding a security analyst to detect cyber threats because it stores a vast range of cyber threat information in the form of semantic triples which can be queried. A semantic triple contains two cybersecurity entities with a relationship between them. In this work, we propose a system to create semantic triples over cybersecurity text, using deep learning approaches to extract possible relationships. We use the set of semantic triples generated through our system to assert in a cybersecurity knowledge graph. Security Analysts can retrieve this data from the knowledge graph, and use this information to form a decision about a cyber-attack.",Cybersecurity,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.02497v2.pdf

These methods have been extensively integrated into traditional scientific disciplines and studied in the philosophy of science. The field of cybersecurity is just beginning to develop preliminary research standards and modeling practices. As such, the science of cybersecurity routinely fails to meet empirical research criteria, such as internal validity, external validity, and construct validity. These standards of experimentation enable the development of metrics, create assurance of experimental soundness, and aid in the generalizability of results. To facilitate such empirical experimentation in cybersecurity, we propose the adaptation of camouflaged cyber simulations as an approach for cybersecurity research.

Cybersecurity is a subject where opinions are plentiful and differing in the public domain. This descriptive research analyzed cybersecurity content on Twitter and Reddit to measure its sentiment, positive or negative, or neutral. The data from Twitter and Reddit was amassed via technology-specific APIs during a selected timeframe to create datasets, which were then analyzed individually for their sentiment by VADER, an NLP (Natural Language Processing) algorithm. A random sample of cybersecurity content (ten tweets and posts) was also classified for sentiments by twenty human annotators to evaluate the performance of VADER. Cybersecurity content on Twitter was at least 48% positive, and Reddit was at least 26.5% positive. The positive or neutral content far outweighed negative sentiments across both platforms. When compared to human classification, which was considered the standard or source of truth, VADER produced 60% accuracy for Twitter and 70% for Reddit in assessing the sentiment; in other words, some agreement between algorithm and human classifiers.

For such text domains that involve high levels of expertise, pretraining on in-domain corpora has been a popular method for language models to obtain domain expertise. However, cybersecurity texts often contain non-linguistic elements (such as URLs and hash values) that could be unsuitable with the established pretraining methodologies. Previous work in other domains have removed or filtered such text as noise, but the effectiveness of these methods have not been investigated, especially in the cybersecurity domain. We propose different pretraining methodologies and evaluate their effectiveness through downstream tasks and probing tasks.

A key reason for this lies in the organisations' lack of a clear understanding of their cybersecurity capabilities, leading to ineffective defences. To address this gap, Cybersecurity Capability Maturity Models (CCMMs) provide a systematic approach to assessing and enhancing an organisation's cybersecurity posture by focusing on capability maturity rather than merely implementing controls. However, their limitations, such as rigid structures, one-size-fits-all approach, complexity, gaps in security scope (i.e., technological, organisational, and human aspects) and lack of quantitative metrics, hinder their effectiveness. It makes implementing CCMMs in varying contexts challenging and results in fragmented, incomprehensive assessments.

Peterson, Enis Golaszewski, Seth Poulsen, Travis Scheponik, Akshita Gorti","We reflect on our ongoing journey in the educational Cybersecurity Assessment Tools (CATS) Project to create two concept inventories for cybersecurity. We identify key steps in this journey and important questions we faced. We explain the decisions we made and discuss the consequences of those decisions, highlighting what worked well and what might have gone better.   The CATS Project is creating and validating two concept inventories---conceptual tests of understanding---that can be used to measure the effectiveness of various approaches to teaching and learning cybersecurity. The Cybersecurity Concept Inventory (CCI) is for students who have recently completed any first course in cybersecurity; the Cybersecurity Curriculum Assessment (CCA) is for students who have recently completed an undergraduate major or track in cybersecurity. Each assessment tool comprises 25 multiple-choice questions (MCQs) of various difficulties that target the same five core concepts, but the CCA assumes greater technical background.   Key steps include defining project scope, identifying the core concepts, uncovering student misconceptions, creating scenarios, drafting question stems, developing distractor answer choices, generating educational materials, performing expert reviews, recruiting student subjects, organizing workshops, building community acceptance, forming a team and nurturing collaboration, adopting tools, and obtaining and using funding.   Creating effective MCQs is difficult and time-consuming, and cybersecurity presents special challenges. Because cybersecurity issues are often subtle, where the adversarial model and details matter greatly, it is challenging to construct MCQs for which there is exactly one best but non-obvious answer.

1802.03178v1,Architectural Tactics for Big Data Cybersecurity Analytic Systems: A   Review,"Faheem Ullah, M. Ali Babar","Context: Big Data Cybersecurity Analytics is aimed at protecting networks, computers, and data from unauthorized access by analysing security event data using big data tools and technologies. Whilst a plethora of Big Data Cybersecurity Analytic Systems have been reported in the literature, there is a lack of a systematic and comprehensive review of the literature from an architectural perspective. Objective: This paper reports a systematic review aimed at identifying the most frequently reported quality attributes and architectural tactics for Big Data Cybersecurity Analytic Systems. Method: We used Systematic Literature Review (SLR) method for reviewing 74 primary studies selected using well-defined criteria. Results: Our findings are twofold: (i) identification of 12 most frequently reported quality attributes and the justification for their significance for Big Data Cybersecurity Analytic Systems; and (ii) identification and codification of 17 architectural tactics for addressing the quality attributes that are commonly associated with Big Data Cybersecurity Analytic systems. The identified tactics include six performance tactics, four accuracy tactics, two scalability tactics, three reliability tactics, and one security and usability tactic each. Conclusion: Our findings have revealed that (a) despite the significance of interoperability, modifiability, adaptability, generality, stealthiness, and privacy assurance, these quality attributes lack explicit architectural support in the literature (b) empirical investigation is required to evaluate the impact of codified architectural tactics (c) a good deal of research effort should be invested to explore the trade-offs and dependencies among the identified tactics and (d) there is a general lack of effective collaboration between academia and industry for supporting the field of Big Data Cybersecurity Analytic Systems.",Cybersecurity,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.03178v1.pdf
1907.10442v1,CAMLPAD: Cybersecurity Autonomous Machine Learning Platform for Anomaly   Detection,"Ayush Hariharan, Ankit Gupta, Trisha Pal","As machine learning and cybersecurity continue to explode in the context of the digital ecosystem, the complexity of cybersecurity data combined with complicated and evasive machine learning algorithms leads to vast difficulties in designing an end to end system for intelligent, automatic anomaly classification. On the other hand, traditional systems use elementary statistics techniques and are often inaccurate, leading to weak centralized data analysis platforms. In this paper, we propose a novel system that addresses these two problems, titled CAMLPAD, for Cybersecurity Autonomous Machine Learning Platform for Anomaly Detection. The CAMLPAD systems streamlined, holistic approach begins with retrieving a multitude of different species of cybersecurity data in real time using elasticsearch, then running several machine learning algorithms, namely Isolation Forest, Histogram Based Outlier Score (HBOS), Cluster Based Local Outlier Factor (CBLOF), and K Means Clustering, to process the data. Next, the calculated anomalies are visualized using Kibana and are assigned an outlier score, which serves as an indicator for whether an alert should be sent to the system administrator that there are potential anomalies in the network. After comprehensive testing of our platform in a simulated environment, the CAMLPAD system achieved an adjusted rand score of 95 percent, exhibiting the reliable accuracy and precision of the system. All in all, the CAMLPAD system provides an accurate, streamlined approach to real time cybersecurity anomaly detection, delivering a novel solution that has the potential to revolutionize the cybersecurity sector.",Cybersecurity,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.10442v1.pdf

The tasks feature diverse assignments, such as exploiting websites, cracking passwords, and breaching unsecured networks. However, it is unclear how the skills practiced by these challenges match formal cybersecurity curricula defined by security experts. We explain the significance of Capture the Flag challenges in cybersecurity training and analyze their 15,963 textual solutions collected since 2012. Based on keywords in the solutions, we map them to well-established ACM/IEEE curricular guidelines to understand which skills the challenges teach. We study the distribution of cybersecurity topics, their variance in different challenge formats, and their development over the past years. The analysis showed the prominence of technical knowledge about cryptography and network security, but human aspects, such as social engineering and cybersecurity awareness, are neglected. We discuss the implications of these results and relate them to contemporary literature. Our results indicate that future Capture the Flag challenges should include non-technical aspects to address the current advanced cyber threats and attract a broader audience to cybersecurity.",Cybersecurity,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.01421v1.pdf

However, deployment of ML in cybersecurity is still at an early stage, revealing a significant discrepancy between research and practice. Such discrepancy has its root cause in the current state-of-the-art, which does not allow to identify the role of ML in cybersecurity. The full potential of ML will never be unleashed unless its pros and cons are understood by a broad audience.   This paper is the first attempt to provide a holistic understanding of the role of ML in the entire cybersecurity domain -- to any potential reader with an interest in this topic.

Securing cyberspace has become an utmost concern for organizations and governments. Traditional Machine Learning (ML) based methods are extensively used in detecting cyber threats, but they hardly model the correlations between real-world cyber entities. In recent years, with the proliferation of graph mining techniques, many researchers investigated these techniques for capturing correlations between cyber entities and achieving high performance. It is imperative to summarize existing graph-based cybersecurity solutions to provide a guide for future studies. Therefore, as a key contribution of this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of graph mining for cybersecurity, including an overview of cybersecurity tasks, the typical graph mining techniques, and the general process of applying them to cybersecurity, as well as various solutions for different cybersecurity tasks. For each task, we probe into relevant methods and highlight the graph types, graph approaches, and task levels in their modeling.

QML has the potential to address cybersecurity related challenges. Considering the novelty and complex architecture of QML, resources are not yet explicitly available that can pave cybersecurity learners to instill efficient knowledge of this emerging technology. In this research, we design and develop QML-based ten learning modules covering various cybersecurity topics by adopting student centering case-study based learning approach. We apply one subtopic of QML on a cybersecurity topic comprised of pre-lab, lab, and post-lab activities towards providing learners with hands-on QML experiences in solving real-world security problems. In order to engage and motivate students in a learning environment that encourages all students to learn, pre-lab offers a brief introduction to both the QML subtopic and cybersecurity problem.

Their potential is meant to assist learners with hands-on practical laboratory exercises irrespective of geographical location. Nevertheless, adopting V Labs in didactic approaches in higher education has seen both merits and demerits. Based on this premise, this study investigates the impact of V Labs on Active Learning (AL) and engagement in cybersecurity distance education. A survey with a limited number of learners and educators who have had an experience with cybersecurity distance courses that leveraged V Labs in their practical Lab assignment, was conducted at Blekinge Tekniska H\""ogskola, Sweden, to assess the impact of V Labs on AL and engagement in Cybersecurity Distance Education. 29% and 73% of the learners and educators, respectively responded to the survey administered remotely and with good internal consistency of questionnaires based on the Cronbalch Alpha; the results showed that learners and educators had a positive perception of using V Labs to enhance AL in cybersecurity distance education. The key concentration of the study was on AL and engagement and problem-solving abilities when V Labs are used.

This has also increased the demand for professionals with the necessary skills to protect these organizations. As a result, many individuals are looking to enter the field of cybersecurity. However, there is a lack of clear understanding of the skills required for a successful career in this field. In this paper, we identify the skills required for cybersecurity professionals. We also determine how the demand for cyber skills relates to various cyber roles such as security analyst and security architect. Furthermore, we identify the programming languages that are important for cybersecurity professionals. Design/Methodology: For this study, we have collected and analyzed data from 12,161 job ads and 49,002 Stack Overflow posts. By examining this, we identified patterns and trends related to skill requirements, role-specific demands, and programming languages in cybersecurity. Findings: Our results reveal that (i) communication skills and project management skills are the most important soft skills, (ii) as compared to soft skills, the demand for technical skills varies more across various cyber roles, and (iii) Java is the most commonly used programming language.

We identified and reviewed 133 V2G cybersecurity studies and found five important insights on existing V2G cybersecurity research. First, most studies (103 of 133) focused on protecting V2G systems against cyber threats, while only seven studies addressed the recovery aspect of the CRML (Cybersecurity Risk Management Lifecycle) function. Second, existing studies have adequately addressed the security of EVs and EVCS (EV charging stations) in V2G systems (112 and 81 of 133 studies, respectively). However, none have focused on the linkage between the behaviour of EV users and the cybersecurity of V2G systems. Third, physical access, control-related vulnerabilities, and user behaviour-related attacks in V2G systems are not addressed significantly. Furthermore, existing studies overlook vulnerabilities and attacks specific to AI and blockchain technologies. Fourth, blockchain, artificial intelligence (AI), encryption, control theory, and optimisation are the main technologies used, and finally, the inclusion of quantum safety within encryption and AI models and AI assurance (AIA) is in a very early stage; only two and one of 133 studies explicitly addressed quantum safety and AIA through explainability.

1603.07438v1,A Characterization of Cybersecurity Posture from Network Telescope Data,"Zhenxin Zhan, Maochao Xu, Shouhuai Xu","Data-driven understanding of cybersecurity posture is an important problem that has not been adequately explored. In this paper, we analyze some real data collected by CAIDA's network telescope during the month of March 2013. We propose to formalize the concept of cybersecurity posture from the perspectives of three kinds of time series: the number of victims (i.e., telescope IP addresses that are attacked), the number of attackers that are observed by the telescope, and the number of attacks that are observed by the telescope. Characterizing cybersecurity posture therefore becomes investigating the phenomena and statistical properties exhibited by these time series, and explaining their cybersecurity meanings. For example, we propose the concept of {\em sweep-time}, and show that sweep-time should be modeled by stochastic process, rather than random variable. We report that the number of attackers (and attacks) from a certain country dominates the total number of attackers (and attacks) that are observed by the telescope. We also show that substantially smaller network telescopes might not be as useful as a large telescope.",Cybersecurity,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.07438v1.pdf

However, the majority of current games are created for advanced players, which often leads to frustration in less experienced learners. Therefore, we decided to focus on a diagnostic assessment of participants entering the games. We assume that information about the players' knowledge, skills, and experience enables tutors or learning environments to suitably assist participants with game challenges and maximize learning in their virtual adventure. In this paper, we present a pioneering experiment examining the predictive value of a short quiz and self-assessment for identifying learners' readiness before playing a cybersecurity game. We hypothesized that these predictors would model players' performance. A linear regression analysis showed that the game performance can be accurately predicted by well-designed prerequisite testing, but not by self-assessment. At the same time, we identified major challenges related to the design of pretests for cybersecurity games: calibrating test questions with respect to the skills relevant for the game, minimizing the quiz's length while maximizing its informative value, and embedding the pretest in the game.

Thus, they exert an important role in the field of cybersecurity. However, state-of-the-art IOCs detection systems rely heavily on hand-crafted features with expert knowledge of cybersecurity, and require a large amount of supervised training corpora to train an IOC classifier. In this paper, we propose using a neural-based sequence labelling model to identify IOCs automatically from reports on cybersecurity without expert knowledge of cybersecurity. Our work is the first to apply an end-to-end sequence labelling to the task in IOCs identification. By using an attention mechanism and several token spelling features, we find that the proposed model is capable of identifying the low frequency IOCs from long sentences contained in cybersecurity reports. Experiments show that the proposed model outperforms other sequence labelling models, achieving over 88% average F1-score.",Cybersecurity,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.10156v1.pdf

Unlike in learning environments that are simplified for young learners, the game features a realistic virtual network infrastructure. This allows exploring security tools in an authentic scenario, which is complemented by a background story. Our research aim is to examine how young players approach using cybersecurity tools by interacting with the professional game. A preliminary analysis of the game session showed several challenges that the workshop participants faced. Nevertheless, they reported learning about security tools and exploits, and 61% of them reported wanting to learn more about cybersecurity after the workshop.

Introducing such events into cybersecurity courses can provide valuable learning experiences for students. The nature of the hackathon format encourages a learning-by-doing approach, and the hackathon outcomes can serve as evidence for students knowledge, capability and learning gains. Prior work on hackathons in education mainly focused on collocated hackathon events in the traditional classroom setting. These hackathon events often took place as a one-off event at the end of the course. However, one-off hackathon events at the end of a course might not be sufficient to improve learning. Instead, we focus on analyzing the integration of a series of online hackathon events into an online cybersecurity course and explore how this integration can address online education issues by encouraging collaboration and developing a practical understanding of the delivered course by solving real-world challenges. We evaluate interventions to foster learning and analyze its effect on collaboration and learning gains for students in the course.

By integrating Internet and social media research tools and questions into its core topics of sub-national violence, terrorism and radical mobilization, digital conflict studies has recently succeeded in addressing some of the data validity and methodology problems faced by the cybersecurity scholarship. This article begins by briefly reviewing some of the persistent data and method-oriented hurdles faced by the cybersecurity scholarship. Then, it moves onto a more detailed account of how digital conflict studies have been addressing some of these deadlocks by focusing individually on the literature on onset, mobilization, targeting, intensity/duration and termination phases of conflicts.

We capture cybersecurity expectations on users as norms. We empirically investigate sanctioning mechanisms in promoting compliance with those norms as well as the detrimental effect of sanctions on the ability of users to complete their work. We realize these ideas in a game that emulates the decision making of workers in a research lab.   Through a human-subject study, we find that whereas individual sanctions are more effective than group sanctions in achieving compliance and less detrimental on the ability of users to complete their work, individual sanctions offer significantly lower resilience especially for organizations comprising risk seekers.

In particular, we encode and aggregate the constituent feature, morphological feature and part of speech feature for each input token to improve the robustness of the method. More than that, a token gets augmented semantic information from its most similar K words in cybersecurity domain corpus where an attentive module is leveraged to weigh differences of the words, and from contextual clues based on a large-scale general field corpus.

Unfortunately, like traditional neural networks, GNNs also suffer from a lack of transparency, that is, it is challenging to interpret the model predictions. Prior works focused on specific factor explanations for a GNN model. In this work, we have designed and implemented Illuminati, a comprehensive and accurate explanation framework for cybersecurity applications using GNN models. Given a graph and a pre-trained GNN model, Illuminati is able to identify the important nodes, edges, and attributes that are contributing to the prediction while requiring no prior knowledge of GNN models. We evaluate Illuminati in two cybersecurity applications, i.e., code vulnerability detection and smart contract vulnerability detection. The experiments show that Illuminati achieves more accurate explanation results than state-of-the-art methods, specifically, 87.6% of subgraphs identified by Illuminati are able to retain their original prediction, an improvement of 10.3% over others at 77.3%. Furthermore, the explanation of Illuminati can be easily understood by the domain experts, suggesting the significant usefulness for the development of cybersecurity applications.",Cybersecurity,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.14836v1.pdf

However, the cybersecurity concerns associated with LLMs have become increasingly prominent. Previous research has primarily focused on patching system vulnerabilities to enhance cybersecurity, but these approaches are not well-suited to the Metaverse, where the virtual space is more complex, LLMs are vulnerable, and ethical user interaction is critical. Moreover, the scope of cybersecurity in the Metaverse is expected to expand significantly. This paper proposes a method for enhancing cybersecurity through the simulation of user interaction with LLMs. Our goal is to educate users and strengthen their defense capabilities through exposure to a comprehensive simulation system. This system includes extensive Metaverse cybersecurity Q&A and attack simulation scenarios. By engaging with these, users will improve their ability to recognize and withstand risks. Additionally, to address the ethical implications of user input, we propose using LLMs as evaluators to assess user content across five dimensions.

Brown","Given the scale of consequences attributable to cyber attacks, the field of cybersecurity has long outgrown ad-hoc decision-making. A popular choice to provide disciplined decision-making in cybersecurity is Game Theory, which seeks to mathematically understand strategic interaction. In practice though, game-theoretic approaches are scarcely utilized (to our knowledge), highlighting the need to understand the deficit between the existing state-of-the-art and the needs of cybersecurity practitioners. Therefore, we develop a framework to characterize the function and assumptions of existing works as applied to cybersecurity and leverage it to characterize 80 unique technical papers. Then, we leverage this information to analyze the capabilities of the proposed models in comparison to the application-specific needs they are meant to serve, as well as the practicality of implementing the proposed solution. Our main finding is that Game Theory largely fails to incorporate notions of uncertainty critical to the application being considered. To remedy this, we provide guidance in terms of how to incorporate uncertainty in a model, what forms of uncertainty are critical to consider in each application area, and how to model the information that is available in each application area.",Cybersecurity,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.13815v2.pdf

In a blockchain application where the task of the application which makes use of the data stored in a blockchain has to be accomplished by a time instant, the employed blockchain is essentially finitely-long. In this paper, we consider a general finitely-long blockchain model which is generalized from most existing works on finitely-long blockchain applications, and take the first step towards characterizing the vulnerability of finitely-long blockchains in securing data against double-spending attacks. For the first time, we develop a general closed-form expression for the probability of success in launching a double-spending attack on a finitely-long blockchain. This probability essentially characterizes the vulnerability of finitely-long blockchains. Then, we prove that the probability of success in launching a double-spending attack on a finitely-long blockchain is no greater than that on an infinitely-long blockchain, which implies that finitely-long blockchains are less vulnerable to double-spending attacks than infinitely-long blockchains. Moreover, we show that unlike infinitely-long blockchains which can be surely paralyzed by a 51% attack, finitely-long blockchains are more resistant to 51% attacks.",Blockchain,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.09965v1.pdf

To overcome these limitations, we introduce Testimonium, a novel blockchain relay scheme that applies a validation-on-demand pattern and the on-chain execution of Simplified Payment Verifications to enable the verification of data across blockchains while remaining fully decentralized. Evaluating the scheme for Ethereum-based blockchains shows that Testimonium achieves a cost reduction of up to 92% over existing solutions. As such, the scheme lays a strong foundation for generic blockchain interoperability.

Such properties may vary over time, and thus, a selected blockchain may become unsuitable for a given use case. This uncertainty may hinder the widespread adoption of blockchain technologies in general. To mitigate the impact of volatile blockchain properties, we propose a framework that monitors several blockchains, allows the user to define functional and non-functional requirements, determines the most appropriate blockchain, and enables the switchover to that chain at runtime. Our evaluation using a reference implementation shows that switching to another blockchain can save cost and enable users to benefit from better performance and a higher level of trust.",Blockchain,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.07014v1.pdf

We identify common primitive elements of both and use them to construct a framework for explicitly articulating what characterizes blockchain networks.

1910.00742v1,ChainSplitter: Towards Blockchain-based Industrial IoT Architecture for   Supporting Hierarchical Storage,"Gang Wang, Zhijie Jerry Shi, Mark Nixon, Song Han","The fast developing Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) technologies provide a promising opportunity to build large-scale systems to connect numerous heterogeneous devices into the Internet. Most existing IIoT infrastructures are based on a centralized architecture, which is easier for management but cannot effectively support immutable and verifiable services among multiple parties. Blockchain technology provides many desired features for large-scale IIoT infrastructures, such as decentralization, trustworthiness, trackability, and immutability. This paper presents a blockchain-based IIoT architecture to support immutable and verifiable services. However, when applying blockchain technology to the IIoT infrastructure, the required storage space posts a grant challenge to resource-constrained IIoT infrastructures. To address the storage issue, this paper proposes a hierarchical blockchain storage structure, \textit{ChainSplitter}. Specially, the proposed architecture features a hierarchical storage structure where the majority of the blockchain is stored in the clouds, while the most recent blocks are stored in the overlay network of the individual IIoT networks. The proposed architecture seamlessly binds local IIoT networks, the blockchain overlay network, and the cloud infrastructure together through two connectors, the \textit{blockchain connector} and the \textit{cloud connector}, to construct the hierarchical blockchain storage. The blockchain connector in the overlay network builds blocks in blockchain from data generated in IIoT networks, and the cloud connector resolves the blockchain synchronization issues between the overlay network and the clouds. We also provide a case study to show the efficiency of the proposed hierarchical blockchain storage in a practical Industrial IoT case.",Blockchain,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.00742v1.pdf
2207.07453v1,A Consensus Algorithm Based on Risk Assessment Model for Permissioned   Blockchain,"Xiaohui Zhang, Mingying Xue, Xianghua Miao","Blockchain technology enables stakeholders to conduct trusted data sharing and exchange without a trusted centralized institution. These features make blockchain applications attractive to enhance trustworthiness in very different contexts. Due to unique design concepts and outstanding performance, blockchain has become a popular research topic in industry and academia in recent years. Every participant is anonymous in a permissionless blockchain represented by cryptocurrency applications such as Bitcoin. In this situation, some special incentive mechanisms are applied to permissionless blockchain, such as mined native cryptocurrency to solve the trust issues of permissionless blockchain. In many use cases, permissionless blockchain has bottlenecks in transaction throughput performance, which restricts further application in the real world. A permissioned blockchain can reach a consensus among a group of entities that do not establish an entire trust relationship. Unlike permissionless blockchains, the participants must be identified in permissioned blockchains. By relying on the traditional crash fault-tolerant consensus protocols, permissioned blockchains can achieve high transaction throughput and low latency without sacrificing security. However, how to balance the security and consensus efficiency is still the issue that needs to be solved urgently in permissioned blockchains. As the core module of blockchain technology, the consensus algorithm plays a vital role in the performance of the blockchain system. Thus, this paper proposes a new consensus algorithm for permissioned blockchain, the Risk Assessment-based Consensus protocol (RAC), combined with the decentralized design concept and the risk-node assessment mechanism to address the unbalance issues of performance in speed, scalability, and security.",Blockchain,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.07453v1.pdf

Since blockchain runs as an immutable distributed ledger, it has decentralized mechanisms with persistency, anonymity, and auditability, where transactions are jointly performed through cryptocurrency-based consensus algorithms by worldwide distributed nodes. There have been many survey papers reviewing the blockchain technologies from different perspectives, e.g., digital currencies, consensus algorithms, and smart contracts. However, none of them have focused on the blockchain data management systems. To fill in this gap, we have conducted a comprehensive survey on the data management systems, based on three typical types of blockchain, i.e., standard blockchain, hybrid blockchain, and DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph)-based blockchain. We categorize their data management mechanisms into three layers: blockchain architecture, blockchain data structure, and blockchain storage engine, where block architecture indicates how to record transactions on a distributed ledger, blockchain data structure refers to the internal structure of each block, and blockchain storage engine specifies the storage form of data on the blockchain system. For each layer, the works advancing the state-of-the-art are discussed together with technical challenges.

2407.17761v1,Towards the Blockchain Massive Adoption with Permissionless Storage,Jia Kan,"Blockchain technology emerged with the advent of Bitcoin and rapidly developed over the past few decades, becoming widely accepted and known by the public. However, in the past decades, the massive adoption of blockchain technology has yet to come. Rather than the scalability issue, the blockchain application is challenged by its expensive usage cost. However, the high cost of blockchain usage is deeply connected with the blockchain consensus and security mechanism. The permissionless blockchain must maintain its high cost for security against the 51% Attack. Chain users indirectly cover the cost as coins are appointed for blockchain usage fees. This conflict prevents the massive adoption of blockchain. Thus, blockchain must be improved to solve those problems: 1. The cost of blockchain usage should be low enough. 2. The blockchain should remain decentralized. 3. The scalability of blockchain must meet the demand.   In my thesis, new approaches are applied to solve the issues above. The key contribution is the discovery of the useful PoW. It extends the Nakamoto PoW with another usage of file data encoding during the same Nakamoto Consensus computation to prove honest data preservation. Based on this theory, a permissionless storage network is proposed as the new security engine for the blockchain. It bridges the high blockchain security cost to the storage users with real demands who are willing to pay for the storage resource. On the other hand, the chain users can benefit from the low transaction fee. Meanwhile, we also provide a scalability solution to shard the blockchain. It enables high TPS and keeps decentralization. The solutions in this thesis provide the answers to all the dependencies of the massive adoption.",Blockchain,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.17761v1.pdf
1907.07099v1,Blockchain Mutability: Challenges and Proposed Solutions,"Eugenia Politou, Fran Casino, Efthimios Alepis, Constantinos Patsakis","Blockchain's evolution during the past decade is astonishing: from bitcoin to over 2.000 altcoins, and from decentralised electronic payments to transactions programmable by smart contracts and complex tokens governed by decentralised organisations. While the new generation of blockchain applications is still evolving, blockchain's technical characteristics are also advancing. Yet, immutability, a hitherto indisputable property according to which blockchain data cannot be edited nor deleted, remains the cornerstone of blockchain's security. Nevertheless, blockchain's immutability is being called into question lately in the light of the new erasing requirements imposed by the GDPR's ``\textit{Right to be Forgotten (RtbF)}'' provision. As the RtbF obliges blockchain data to be editable in order restricted content redactions, modifications or deletions to be applied when requested, blockchains compliance with the regulation is indeed challenging, if not impracticable. Towards resolving this contradiction, various methods and techniques for mutable blockchains have been proposed in an effort to satisfy regulatory erasing requirements while preserving blockchains' security. To this end, this work aims to provide a comprehensive review on the state-of-the-art research approaches, technical workarounds and advanced cryptographic techniques that have been put forward to resolve this conflict and to discuss their potentials, constraints and limitations when applied in the wild to either permissioned or permissionless blockchains.",Blockchain,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.07099v1.pdf

Existing techniques either work only for two blockchains or requires a centralized component to govern the cross-blockchain transaction execution, neither of which would meet the scalability requirement. This paper proposes a new distributed commit protocol, namely \textit{cross-blockchain transaction} (CBT), for conducting transactions across an arbitrary number of blockchains without any centralized component. The key idea of CBT is to extend the two-phase commit protocol with a heartbeat mechanism to ensure the liveness of CBT without introducing additional nodes or blockchains. We have implemented CBT and compared it to the state-of-the-art protocols, demonstrating CBT's low overhead (3.6\% between two blockchains, less than $1\%$ among 32 or more blockchains) and high scalability (linear scalability on up to 64-blockchain transactions).

Recently, Libra was proposed by Facebook based on a permissioned blockchain, i.e. the Libra blockchain. The vision of Libra is to become a global currency supporting financial applications, but it is doubted whether the performance of the Libra blockchain is able to support frequent micropayment scenarios. In this paper, we propose a methodology to evaluate the performance of blockchain platforms and conducted an experimental study on the Libra blockchain. The results show that the Libra blockchain can only process about one thousand transactions per second at most, and the performance drops significantly as the number of validators increases. Although it outperforms permissionless blockchain platforms, the performance of the Libra blockchain is still unsatisfactory compared to other permissioned blockchains like Hyperledger Fabric and needs to make effective improvements in order to support global micropayment in the future.",Blockchain,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.05241v1.pdf

The current blockchain technology faces scalability issues, which include two aspects: low transaction throughput and high storage capacity costs. This paper studies the blockchain structure based on state sharding technology, and mainly solves the problem of non-scalability of block chain storage. This paper designs and implements the blockchain state sharding scheme, proposes a specific state sharding data structure and algorithm implementation, and realizes a complete blockchain structure so that the blockchain has the advantages of high throughput, processing a large number of transactions and saving storage costs. Experimental results show that a blockchain network with more than 100,000 nodes can be divided into 1024 shards. A blockchain network with this structure can process 500,000 transactions in about 5 seconds. If the consensus time of the blockchain is about 10 seconds, and the block generation time of the blockchain system of the sharding mechanism is 15 seconds, the transaction throughput can reach 33,000 tx/sec. Experimental results show that the throughput of the proposed protocol increases with the increase of the network node size. This confirms the scalability of the blockchain structure based on sharding technology.",Blockchain,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.16034v1.pdf
2212.14671v1,Novel Architecture to Create and Maintain Personal Blockchains,"Collin Connors, Dilip Sarkar","Blockchain has been touted as a revolutionary technology. However, despite the excitement, blockchain has not been adopted in many fields. Many are hesitant to adopt blockchain technology due to privacy concerns, barriers to use, or lack of practical use cases. In this work, we outline a potential blockchain use case for tracking financial transactions across multiple financial institutions. We show the downsides of traditional centralized approaches and that blockchain approaches fail to give all the privacy and accessibility required for this use case. Thus we propose a novel blockchain architecture to support our use case. This novel architecture combines the ease of use of public blockchains with the privacy of private blockchains by allowing users to create personal blockchains. We believe this novel personal blockchain architecture will lead to more blockchain adoption, particularly in use cases handling private data.",Blockchain,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.14671v1.pdf
2305.03895v1,Rateless Coded Blockchain for Dynamic IoT Networks,"Changlin Yang, Alexei Ashikhmin, Xiaodong Wang, Zibin Zheng","A key constraint that limits the implementation of blockchain in Internet of Things (IoT) is its large storage requirement resulting from the fact that each blockchain node has to store the entire blockchain. This increases the burden on blockchain nodes, and increases the communication overhead for new nodes joining the network since they have to copy the entire blockchain. In order to reduce storage requirements without compromising on system security and integrity, coded blockchains, based on error correcting codes with fixed rates and lengths, have been recently proposed. This approach, however, does not fit well with dynamic IoT networks in which nodes actively leave and join. In such dynamic blockchains, the existing coded blockchain approaches lead to high communication overheads for new joining nodes and may have high decoding failure probability. This paper proposes a rateless coded blockchain with coding parameters adjusted to network conditions. Our goals are to minimize both the storage requirement at each blockchain node and the communication overhead for each new joining node, subject to a target decoding failure probability. We evaluate the proposed scheme in the context of real-world Bitcoin blockchain and show that both storage and communication overhead are reduced by 99.6\% with a maximum $10^{-12}$ decoding failure probability.",Blockchain,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.03895v1.pdf
2305.04723v1,PBL: System for Creating and Maintaining Personal Blockchain Ledgers,"Collin Connors, Dilip Sarkar","Blockchain technology has experienced substantial growth in recent years, yet the diversity of blockchain applications has been limited. Blockchain provides many desirable features for applications, including being append-only, immutable, tamper-evident, tamper-resistant, and fault-tolerant; however, many applications that would benefit from these features cannot incorporate current blockchains. This work presents a novel architecture for creating and maintaining personal blockchain ledgers that address these concerns. Our system utilizes independent modular services, enabling individuals to securely store their data in a personal blockchain ledger. Unlike traditional blockchain, which stores all transactions of multiple users, our novel personal blockchains are designed to allow individuals to maintain their privacy without requiring extensive technical expertise. Using rigorous mathematical methods, we prove that our system produces append-only, immutable, tamper-evident, tamper-resistant ledgers. Our system addresses use cases not addressed by traditional blockchain development platforms. Our system creates a new blockchain paradigm, enabling more individuals and applications to leverage blockchain technology for their needs.",Blockchain,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.04723v1.pdf
2405.08395v1,Cross-Blockchain Communication Using Oracles With an Off-Chain   Aggregation Mechanism Based on zk-SNARKs,"Michael Sober, Giulia Scaffino, Stefan Schulte","The closed architecture of prevailing blockchain systems renders the usage of this technology mostly infeasible for a wide range of real-world problems. Most blockchains trap users and applications in their isolated space without the possibility of cooperating or switching to other blockchains. Therefore, blockchains need additional mechanisms for seamless communication and arbitrary data exchange between each other and external systems. Unfortunately, current approaches for cross-blockchain communication are resource-intensive or require additional blockchains or tailored solutions depending on the applied consensus mechanisms of the connected blockchains. Therefore, we propose an oracle with an off-chain aggregation mechanism based on ZeroKnowledge Succinct Non-interactive Arguments of Knowledge (zk-SNARKs) to facilitate cross-blockchain communication. The oracle queries data from another blockchain and applies a rollup-like mechanism to move state and computation off-chain. The zkOracle contract only expects the transferred data, an updated state root, and proof of the correct execution of the aggregation mechanism. The proposed solution only requires constant 378 kgas to submit data on the Ethereum blockchain and is primarily independent of the underlying technology of the queried blockchains.",Blockchain,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.08395v1.pdf

To comprehensively examine blockchain systems, this article presents both a macro-level overview on the most popular blockchain systems, and a micro-level analysis on a general blockchain framework and its crucial components. The macro-level exploration provides a big picture on the endeavors made by blockchain professionals over the years to enhance the blockchain performance while the micro-level investigation details the blockchain building blocks for deep technology comprehension. More specifically, this article introduces a general modular blockchain analytic framework that decomposes a blockchain system into interacting modules and then examines the major modules to cover the essential blockchain components of network, consensus, and distributed ledger at the micro-level. The framework as well as the modular analysis jointly build a foundation for designing scalable, flexible, and application-adaptive blockchains that can meet diverse requirements.

2402.00220v4,A Circuit Approach to Constructing Blockchains on Blockchains,"Ertem Nusret Tas, David Tse, Yifei Wang","Since the creation of Bitcoin 15 years ago, there has been an explosion in the number of permissionless blockchains. Each of these blockchains provides an open ledger that anyone can read from and write to. In this multi-chain world, an important question emerges: how can we build a more secure overlay blockchain by reading from and writing to a given set of blockchains? Drawing an analogy with switching circuits, we approach the problem by defining two basic compositional operations between blockchains, serial and triangular compositions, and use these operations as building blocks to construct general overlay blockchains. Under the partially synchronous setting, we have the following results: 1) the serial composition, between two blockchains, yields an overlay blockchain that is safe if at least one of the two underlay blockchains is safe and that is live if both of them are live; 2) the triangular composition between three blockchains, akin to parallel composition of switching circuits, yields an overlay blockchain that is safe if all underlay blockchains are safe and that is live if over half of them are live; 3) repeated composition of these two basic operations can yield all possible tradeoffs of safety and liveness for an overlay blockchain built on arbitrary number of underlay chains. The results are also extended to the synchronous setting.",Blockchain,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.00220v4.pdf

Bitcoin is a decentralized currency that does not rely on third-party credit institutions, and the core of Bitcoin's underlying technology is blockchain. With the increasing value of Bitcoin and the vigorous development of decentralization, people's research on blockchain is also increasing day by day. Today's blockchain technology has not only made great achievements in the application of Bitcoin, but has also been preliminarily applied in other fields, such as finance, medical treatment, the Internet of Things, and so on. However, with the initial application of blockchain technology on the Internet, the security of blockchain technology has also been widely concerned by people in the industry. For example, whether currency trading platforms, smart contracts, blockchain consensus mechanisms, and other technologies are vulnerable to attacks, and how we can defend against these attacks digitally and optimize the blockchain system is exactly the subject we want to study. For the security of appeal blockchain, this paper first analyzes the security threats faced by the application digital currency trading platform of the blockchain system, then analyzes the security problems of smart contract closely related to blockchain 2.0, and then analyzes and studies the security threats of blockchain public chain, consensus mechanism, and P2P.

Blockchain incorporates innovative ideas from various fields, such as public-key encryption and distributed systems. As a result, readers often encounter resources that explain Blockchain technology from a single perspective, leaving them with more questions than answers.   In this primer, we aim to provide a comprehensive view of blockchain. We will begin with a brief history and introduce the building blocks of the blockchain.

2001.07023v1,Segment blockchain: A size reduced storage mechanism for blockchain,"Yibin Xu, Yangyu Huang","The exponential growth of the blockchain size has become a major contributing factor that hinders the decentralisation of blockchain and its potential implementations in data-heavy applications. In this paper, we propose segment blockchain, an approach that segmentises blockchain and enables nodes to only store a copy of one blockchain segment. We use \emph{PoW} as a membership threshold to limit the number of nodes taken by an Adversary---the Adversary can only gain at most $n/2$ of nodes in a network of $n$ nodes when it has $50\%$ of the calculation power in the system (the Nakamoto blockchain security threshold). A segment blockchain system fails when an Adversary stores all copies of a segment, because the Adversary can then leave the system, causing a permanent loss of the segment. We theoretically prove that segment blockchain can sustain a $(AD/n)^m$ failure probability when the Adversary has no more than $AD$ number of nodes and every segment is stored by $m$ number of nodes. The storage requirement is mostly shrunken compared to the traditional design and therefore making the blockchain more suitable for data-heavy applications.",Blockchain,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.07023v1.pdf

However, few of them could reveal the concerns of front-line developers and the situations of blockchain in practice. In this article, we investigate how developers use and discuss blockchain with a case study of Stack Overflow posts. We find blockchain is a relatively new topic in Stack Overflow but it is rising to popularity.

1905.09359v1,Towards Global Asset Management in Blockchain Systems,"Victor Zakhary, Mohammad Javad Amiri, Sujaya Maiyya, Divyakant Agrawal, Amr El Abbadi","Permissionless blockchains (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc) have shown a wide success in implementing global scale peer-to-peer cryptocurrency systems. In such blockchains, new currency units are generated through the mining process and are used in addition to transaction fees to incentivize miners to maintain the blockchain. Although it is clear how currency units are generated and transacted on, it is unclear how to use the infrastructure of permissionless blockchains to manage other assets than the blockchain's currency units (e.g., cars, houses, etc). In this paper, we propose a global asset management system by unifying permissioned and permissionless blockchains. A governmental permissioned blockchain authenticates the registration of end-user assets through smart contract deployments on a permissionless blockchain. Afterwards, end-users can transact on their assets through smart contract function calls (e.g., sell a car, rent a room in a house, etc). In return, end-users get paid in currency units of the same blockchain or other blockchains through atomic cross-chain transactions and governmental offices receive taxes on these transactions in cryptocurrency units.",Blockchain,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.09359v1.pdf
2106.05463v1,Cross-chain Interaction Model In a Fully Verified Way,Hong Su,"There are different kinds of blockchains, which have been applied in various areas. Blockchains are relatively independent systems that are apt to form isolated data islands. Then cross-chain interaction is proposed to connect different blockchains. However, the current cross-chain methods do not maintain the security of the original blockchain. They either depend on a less secure third-party system or a less secure method. This makes the cross-chain interaction less secure than the original blockchains (the security downgrade issues), or the cross-chain interaction can be done even if the paired blockchain does not exist (the blockchain invisible issue). In this paper, we first propose a system interaction model and use it to analyze the possible security issues. Based on conclusions got from the proposed model, we propose the cross-chain method that verifies the data of the paired blockchain by the consensus algorithm of the paired blockchain (the CIFuV method). With this method, the cross-chain interaction can be as the same security as in the paired blockchain. At last, we evaluate the security issues during the system interaction process, and the possibility to have the CIFuV model on the public blockchains.",Blockchain,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.05463v1.pdf

It also determines the decentralization, security, and efficiency of blockchain. Existing mechanisms all have certain centralization issues and fail to ensure the decentralization of blockchain networks. A decentralized and efficient mechanism is required to improve blockchain systems. This paper proposes a fair consensus mechanism called Proof of Verifiable Functions (PoVF), based on the verifiability and unpredictability of verifiable functions. PoVF provides a sufficiently fair mechanism, ensuring that all nodes in blockchain network have equal opportunity to participate in consensus. In addition, a structure called ""Delay buffer"" is proposed to ensure transactions are executed sequentially. It delay the selection of blocks to avoid blockchain forks caused by broadcasting and transaction execution confusion. According to our security analysis, PoVF is provably secure and has the ability to resist potential adversaries. According to the experiments, PoVF-based blockchain can process up to 4000 transactions per second with nodes configured with only 4-core CPUs. This paper uses the Gini coefficient to measure the decentralization of blockchains, and the PoVF-based blockchain achieves the lowest Gini coefficient of 0.39 among all sampled blockchains.

1903.02752v1,Anonymous State Pinning for Private Blockchains,"Peter Robinson, John Brainard","Public blockchains such as Ethereum and Bitcoin provide transparency and accountability, and have strong non-repudiation properties, but fall far short of enterprise privacy requirements for business processes. Consequently consortiums are exploring private blockchains to keep their membership and transactions private. However, private blockchains do not provide adequate protection against potential collusion by consortium members to revert the state of the blockchain. To countenance this, the private blockchain state may be ""pinned"" to a tamper resistant public blockchain. Existing solutions offering pinning to the public blockchain would reveal the transaction rate of the private blockchain, and do not provide a mechanism to contest the validity of a pin. Moreover, they require that all transactions and members of the private blockchain be revealed. These challenges are hampering the wider adoption of private blockchain technology. We describe the primary author's `Anonymous State Pinning approach', which overcomes these limitations and present a security proof to demonstrate pins can be challenged without compromising these properties. We perform a gas cost analysis of the implementation to estimate the operating cost of this technology, which shows that pinning a private blockchain at the rate of one pin per hour would cost US$508 per year. A hierarchical pinning approach is proposed which would allow many private blockchains to pin to a management blockchain which would then pin to Ethereum MainNet. This approach saves money, but at the cost of increased finality times.",Blockchain,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.02752v1.pdf
1906.04421v2,The merits of using Ethereum MainNet as a Coordination Blockchain for   Ethereum Private Sidechains,Peter Robinson,"A Coordination Blockchain is a blockchain with the task of coordinating activities of multiple private blockchains. This paper discusses the pros and cons of using Ethereum MainNet, the public Ethereum blockchain, as a Coordination Blockchain. The requirements Ethereum MainNet needs to fulfil to perform this role are discussed within the context of Ethereum Private Sidechains, a private blockchain technology which allows many blockchains to be operated in parallel, and allows atomic crosschain transactions to execute across blockchains. Ethereum MainNet is a permissionless network which aims to offer strong authenticity, integrity, and non-repudiation properties, that incentivises good behaviour using crypto economics. This paper demonstrates that Ethereum MainNet does deliver these properties. It then provides a comprehensive review of the features of Ethereum Private Sidechains, with a focus on the potential usage of Coordination Blockchains for these features. Finally, the merits of using Ethereum MainNet as a Coordination Blockchain are assessed. For Ethereum Private Sidechains, we found that Ethereum MainNet is best suited to storing long term static data that needs to be widely available, such as the Ethereum Registration Authority information. However, due to Ethereum MainNet's probabilistic finality, it is not well suited to information that needs to be available and acted upon immediately, such as the Sidechain Public Keys and Atomic Crosschain Transaction state information that need to be accessible prior to the first atomic crosschain transaction being issued on a sidechain. Although this paper examined the use of Ethereum MainNet as a Coordination Blockchain within reference to Ethereum Private Sidechains, the discussions and observations of the typical tasks a Coordination blockchain may be expected to perform are applicable more widely to any multi-blockchain system.",Blockchain,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.04421v2.pdf

Compared with traditional centralized approaches, blockchain-based solutions are able to exploit the advantages of blockchain to realize better functionality in smart grids. However, the blockchain technology itself has its disadvantages in low processing throughput and weak privacy protection. Therefore, it is of paramount importance to study how to integrate blockchain with smart grids in a more effective way so that the advantages of blockchain can be maximized and its disadvantages can be avoided.   This article surveys the state-of-the-art solutions aiming to integrate the emergent blockchain technology with smart grids. The goal of this survey is to discuss the necessity of applying blockchain in different components of smart grids, identify the challenges encountered by current solutions, and highlight the frameworks and techniques used to integrate blockchain with smart grids. We also present thorough comparison studies among blockchain-based solutions for smart grids from different perspectives, with the aim to provide insights on integrating blockchain with smart grids for different smart grid management tasks. Finally, we list the current projects and initiatives demonstrating the current effort from the practice side. Additionally, we draw attention to open problems that have not yet been tackled by existing solutions, and point out possible future research directions.",Blockchain,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.14130v1.pdf
1801.02027v1,A First Step in the Co-Evolution of Blockchain and Ontologies: Towards   Engineering an Ontology of Governance at the Blockchain Protocol Level,"Henry M. Kim, Marek Laskowski, Ning Nan","At the beginning of 2018, there is a growing belief that blockchain technologies constitute a revolutionary innovation in how we transfer value electronically. In that vein, blockchain may be a suitable complement to ontologies to achieve a big part of the vision of the semantic Web by Tim Berners-Lee. We believe that if this complementarity is to be achieved blockchain and ontologies must co-evolve. In this paper, we focus on what and how to engineer models, methods, designs, and implementations for this co-evolution. As a first step in this co-evolution, we propose a conceptual design of a governance ontology represented as meta-data tags to be embedded and instantiated in a smart contract at the blockchain protocol level. We develop this design by examining and analyzing smart contracts from the infamous The DAO experiment on the Ethereum blockchain. We believe there are two contributions of this paper: it serves to inform and implore the blockchain and ontology communities to recognize and collaborate with each other; and it outlines a roadmap for engineering artifacts to bridge the gap between blockchain community focus on protocol-level blockchain interoperability and the ontology community focus on semantic-level interoperability.",Blockchain,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.02027v1.pdf
1903.03954v1,Permissionless Blockchains and Secure Logging,"Chunpeng Ge, Siwei Sun, Pawel Szalachowski","The blockchain technology enables mutually untrusting participants to reach consensus on the state of a distributed and decentralized ledger (called a blockchain) in a permissionless setting. The consensus protocol of the blockchain imposes a unified view of the system state over the global network, and once a block is stable in the blockchain, its data is visible to all users and cannot be retrospectively modified or removed. Due to these properties, the blockchain technology is regarded as a general consensus infrastructure and based on which a variety of systems have been built. This article presents a study and survey of permissionless blockchain systems in the context of secure logging. We postulate the most essential properties required by a secure logging system and by considering a wide range of applications, we give insights into how the blockchain technology matches these requirements. Based on the survey, we motivate related research perspectives and challenges for blockchain-based secure logging systems, and we highlight potential solutions to some specific problems.",Blockchain,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.03954v1.pdf
1805.00860v1,Erasure code-based low storage blockchain node,"Doriane Perard, Jérôme Lacan, Yann Bachy, Jonathan Detchart","The concept of a decentralized ledger usually implies that each node of a blockchain network stores the entire blockchain. However, in the case of popular blockchains, which each weigh several hundreds of GB, the large amount of data to be stored can incite new or low-capacity nodes to run lightweight clients. Such nodes do not participate to the global storage effort and can result in a centralization of the blockchain by very few nodes, which is contrary to the basic concepts of a blockchain.   To avoid this problem, we propose new low storage nodes that store a reduced amount of data generated from the blockchain by using erasure codes. The properties of this technique ensure that any block of the chain can be easily rebuild from a small number of such nodes. This system should encourage low storage nodes to contribute to the storage of the blockchain and to maintain decentralization despite of a globally increasing size of the blockchain. This system paves the way to new types of blockchains which would only be managed by low capacity nodes.",Blockchain,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.00860v1.pdf

Modern blockchains underpin a variety of applications: from designing a global identity to improving satellite connectivity. In our research we look at the ability of blockchains to store metadata in an increasing volume of transactions and with evolving focus of utilization. We further show that basic approaches to improving blockchain privacy also rely on embedding metadata. This paper identifies and classifies real-life blockchain transactions embedding metadata of a number of major protocols running essentially over the bitcoin blockchain. The empirical analysis here presents the evolution of metadata utilization in the recent years, and the discussion suggests steps towards preventing criminal use. Metadata are relevant to any blockchain, and our analysis considers primarily bitcoin as a case study. The paper concludes that simultaneously with both expanding legitimate utilization of embedded metadata and expanding blockchain functionality, the applied research on improving anonymity and security must also attempt to protect against blockchain abuse.",Blockchain,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.06738v1.pdf

Miraz,"Blockchain, as well as Internet of Things (IoT), is considered as two major disruptive emerging technologies. However, both of them suffer from innate technological limitations to some extent. IoT requires strengthening its security features while Blockchain inherently possesses them due to its extensive use of cryptographic mechanisms and Blockchain, in an inverted manner, needs contributions from the distributed nodes for its P2P (Peer-to-Peer) consensus model while IoT rudimentarily embodies them within its architecture. This chapter, therefore, acutely dissects the viability, along with prospective challenges, of incorporating Blockchain with IoT technologies,inducing the notion of Blockchain of Things (BCoT), as well as the benefits such consolidation can offer.",Blockchain,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.06898v1.pdf

2003.06128v2,On Exploiting Transaction Concurrency To Speed Up Blockchains,"Daniël Reijsbergen, Tien Tuan Anh Dinh","Consensus protocols are currently the bottlenecks that prevent blockchain systems from scaling. However, we argue that transaction execution is also important to the performance and security of blockchains. In other words, there are ample opportunities to speed up and further secure blockchains by reducing the cost of transaction execution.   Our goal is to understand how much we can speed up blockchains by exploiting transaction concurrency available in blockchain workloads. To this end, we first analyze historical data of seven major public blockchains, namely Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, Dogecoin, Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, and Zilliqa. We consider two metrics for concurrency, namely the single-transaction conflict rate per block, and the group conflict rate per block. We find that there is more concurrency in UTXO-based blockchains than in account-based ones, although the amount of concurrency in the former is lower than expected. Another interesting finding is that some blockchains with larger blocks have more concurrency than blockchains with smaller blocks. Next, we propose an analytical model for estimating the transaction execution speed-up given an amount of concurrency. Using results from our empirical analysis, the model estimates that 6x speed-ups in Ethereum can be achieved if all available concurrency is exploited.",Blockchain,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.06128v2.pdf
2004.05933v3,Smart Contracts on the Move,"Enrique Fynn, Alysson Bessani, Fernando Pedone","Blockchain systems have received much attention and promise to revolutionize many services. Yet, despite their popularity, current blockchain systems exist in isolation, that is, they cannot share information. While interoperability is crucial for blockchain to reach widespread adoption, it is difficult to achieve due to differences among existing blockchain technologies. This paper presents a technique to allow blockchain interoperability. The core idea is to provide a primitive operation to developers so that contracts and objects can switch from one blockchain to another, without breaking consistency and violating key blockchain properties. To validate our ideas, we implemented our protocol in two popular blockchain clients that use the Ethereum virtual machine. We discuss how to build applications using the proposed protocol and show examples of applications based on real use cases that can move across blockchains. To analyze the system performance we use a real trace from one of the most popular Ethereum applications and replay it in a multi-blockchain environment.",Blockchain,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.05933v3.pdf
1908.09343v3,HyperService: Interoperability and Programmability Across Heterogeneous   Blockchains,"Zhuotao Liu, Yangxi Xiang, Jian Shi, Peng Gao, Haoyu Wang, Xusheng Xiao, Bihan Wen, Yih-Chun Hu","Blockchain interoperability, which allows state transitions across different blockchain networks, is critical functionality to facilitate major blockchain adoption. Existing interoperability protocols mostly focus on atomic token exchange between blockchains. However, as blockchains have been upgraded from passive distributed ledgers into programmable state machines (thanks to smart contracts), the scope of blockchain interoperability goes beyond just token exchange. In this paper, we present HyperService, the first platform that delivers interoperability and programmability across heterogeneous blockchains. HyperService is powered by two innovative designs: (i) a developer-facing programming framework that allows developers to build cross-chain applications in a unified programming model; and (ii) a secure blockchain-facing cryptography protocol that provably realizes those applications on blockchains. We implement a prototype of HyperService in about 35,000 lines of code to demonstrate its practicality. Our experiment results show that HyperService imposes reasonable latency, in order of seconds, on the end-to-end execution of cross-chain applications",Blockchain,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.09343v3.pdf
2010.07352v2,Towards Cross-Blockchain Smart Contracts,"Markus Nissl, Emanuel Sallinger, Stefan Schulte, Michael Borkowski","In recent years, manifold blockchain protocols have been proposed by researchers and industrial companies alike. This has led to a very heterogeneous blockchain landscape. Accordingly, it would be desirable if blockchains could interact with each other. However, current blockchain technologies offer only limited support for interoperability, thus preventing tokens or smart contracts from leaving the scope of a particular blockchain.   As a first step towards a solution for cross-chain smart contract interactions, we introduce a framework which allows to invoke a smart contract from another blockchain. We offer support for continuing a smart contract after receiving a result from a different blockchain, and for calling smart contracts recursively across blockchains. We provide a reference implementation for Ethereum-based blockchains using Solidity and evaluate the performance regarding time and cost overheads.",Blockchain,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.07352v2.pdf

However, although a large number of research studies have been proposed to understand the diverse characteristics of individual blockchain systems (e.g., Bitcoin or Ethereum), little is known at a comprehensive level on the evolution of blockchain ecosystems at scale, longitudinally, and across multiple blockchains. We argue that understanding the dynamics of blockchain ecosystems could provide unique insights that cannot be achieved through studying a single static snapshot or a single blockchain network alone. Based on billions of transaction records collected from three representative and popular blockchain systems (Bitcoin, Ethereum and EOSIO) over 10 years, we conduct the first study on the evolution of multiple blockchain ecosystems from different perspectives. Our exploration suggests that, although the overall blockchain ecosystem shows promising growth over the last decade, a number of worrying outliers exist that have disrupted its evolution.",Blockchain,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.07534v1.pdf

The integration of blockchain and edge computing can further improve the resource utilization in terms of network, computing, storage, and security. This paper aims to present a survey on the integration of blockchain and edge computing. In particular, we first give an overview of blockchain and edge computing. We then present a general architecture of an integration of blockchain and edge computing system.

However, the defects of on-chain algorithmic mechanisms, and tedious disputes and debates in off-chain communities may affect the operation of blockchain systems. Accordingly, blockchain governance has received great interest for supporting the design, use, and maintenance of blockchain systems, hence improving the overall trustworthiness. Although much effort has been put into this research topic, there is a distinct lack of consideration for blockchain governance from the perspective of software architecture design. In this study, we propose a pattern-oriented reference architecture for governance-driven blockchain systems, which can provide guidance for future blockchain architecture design. We design the reference architecture based on an extensive review of architecture patterns for blockchain governance in academic literature and industry implementation. The reference architecture consists of four layers. We demonstrate the components in each layer, annotating with the identified patterns. A qualitative analysis of mapping two concrete blockchain architectures, Polkadot and Quorum, on the reference architecture is conducted, to evaluate the correctness and utility of proposed reference architecture.",Blockchain,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.04811v2.pdf

However, the intimacy between private blockchain and deterministic database has never been studied. In essence, private blockchain and deterministic database both ensure replica consistency by determinism. In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis to uncover the connections between private blockchain and deterministic database. While private blockchains have started to pursue deterministic transaction executions recently, deterministic databases have already studied deterministic concurrency control protocols for almost a decade. This motivates us to propose Harmony, a novel deterministic concurrency control protocol designed for blockchain use. We use Harmony to build a new relational blockchain, namely HarmonyBC, which features low abort rates, hotspot resiliency, and inter-block parallelism, all of which are especially important to disk-oriented blockchain. Empirical results on Smallbank, YCSB, and TPC-C show that HarmonyBC offers 2.0x to 3.5x throughput better than the state-of-the-art private blockchains.",Blockchain,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.15163v1.pdf

2308.02163v3,BlockChain I/O: Enabling Cross-Chain Commerce,"Anwitaman Datta, Daniël Reijsbergen, Jingchi Zhang, Suman Majumder","Blockchain technology enables secure tokens transfers in digital marketplaces, and recent advances in this field provide other desirable properties such as efficiency, privacy, and price stability. However, these properties do not always generalize to a setting across multiple independent blockchains. Despite the growing number of existing blockchain platforms, there is a lack of an overarching framework whose components provide all of the necessary properties for practical cross-chain commerce. We present BlockChain I/O to provide such a framework. BlockChain I/O introduces entities called cross-chain services to relay information between different blockchains. The proposed design ensures that cross-chain services cannot violate transaction safety, and they are furthermore disincentivized from other types of misbehavior through an audit system. BlockChain I/O uses native stablecoins to mitigate price fluctuations, and a decentralized ID system to allow users to prove aspects of their identity without violating privacy. After presenting the core architecture of BlockChain I/O, we demonstrate how to use it to implement a cross-chain marketplace and discuss how its desirable properties continue to hold in the end-to-end system.

While offering numerous advantages, these components expose various attack surfaces, leading to severe threats to blockchains. In this study, we unveil a novel attack surface, i.e., the state storage, in blockchains. The state storage, based on the Merkle Patricia Trie, plays a crucial role in maintaining blockchain state. Besides, we design Nurgle, the first Denial-of-Service attack targeting the state storage. By proliferating intermediate nodes within the state storage, Nurgle forces blockchains to expend additional resources on state maintenance and verification, impairing their performance. We conduct a comprehensive and systematic evaluation of Nurgle, including the factors affecting it, its impact on blockchains, its financial cost, and practically demonstrating the resulting damage to blockchains. The implications of Nurgle extend beyond the performance degradation of blockchains, potentially reducing trust in them and the value of their cryptocurrencies. Additionally, we further discuss three feasible mitigations against Nurgle.

Consequently, it is essential to develop methods that reinforce blockchain technology against quantum attacks. In response to this challenge, two distinct approaches have been proposed.

Since the uptake of e-commerce and e-services has seen unprecedented serge in recent months due to the global COVID-19 pandemic era, the security of such transactions in optical communication has gained much importance. Optical fiber communication networks are vulnerable to several types of security threats, such as single point failure, wormhole attacks, and sybil attacks. Therefore, blockchain is a promising solution to protect confidential information against attacks and helps in achieving trusted network architecture by creating a distributed ledger platform. Recently, blockchain has received much attention because of its decentralized and distributed ledger technology. Hence, blockchain has also been employed to protect network against such attacks. However, blockchain technology's security relies on the platform of computational complexity, and because of the evolution of quantum computers, it will become insecure in the near future. Therefore, for enhancing blockchain security, research focus on combining quantum key distribution (QKD) with blockchain. This new technology is known as quantum-secured blockchain. The article describes the attacks in optical networks and provides a solution to protect network against security attacks by employing quantum-secured blockchain in optical networks. It provides a brief overview of blockchain technology with its security loopholes and focuses on QKD, which makes blockchain technology more robust against quantum-attacks.

Various centralized federated learning frameworks like FedML, have emerged in the community to help boost the research on FL. However, decentralized blockchain-based federated learning framework is still missing, which cause inconvenience for researcher to reproduce or verify the algorithm performance based on blockchain.

The immutability, however, also introduces threats and challenges with respect to privacy laws and illegal content. Introducing a certain degree of mutability, which enables the possibility to store and remove information, can therefore increase the opportunities for blockchains. In this paper, we present a concept for a mutable blockchain structure. Our approach enables the removal of certain blocks, while maintaining the blockchain's verifiability property. Since our concept is agnostic to any consensus algorithms, it can be implemented with permissioned and permissionless blockchains.",Blockchain,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.15935v1.pdf

It allows for inter-contract and inter-blockchain function calls that are both synchronous and atomic: if one part fails, the whole call graph of function calls is rolled back. Existing atomic cross-blockchain function call protocols are Blockchain Layer 1 protocols, which require changes to the blockchain platform software to operate.

Blockchain consensus algorithms are the primary vehicle for the nodes within a blockchain network to reach an agreement. In recent years, many blockchain consensus algorithms have been proposed mainly for private and permissioned blockchain networks. However, the performance of these algorithms and their reliability in hostile environments or the presence of byzantine and other network failures are not well understood. In addition, the testing and validation of blockchain applications come with many technical challenges. In this paper, we apply chaos engineering and testing to understand the performance of consensus algorithms in the presence of different loads, byzantine failure and other communication failure scenarios. We apply chaos engineering to evaluate the performance of three different consensus algorithms (PBFT, Clique, Raft) and their respective blockchain platforms. We measure the blockchain network's throughput, latency, and success rate while executing chaos and load tests. We develop lightweight blockchain applications to execute our test in a semi-production environment.

It has been widely acknowledged that no single blockchain network will fit all use cases. As a result, we have observed the increasing popularity of multi-blockchain ecosystem in which customers will move toward different blockchains based on their particular requirements. Hence, the efficiency and security requirements of interactions among these heterogeneous blockchains become critical. In realization of this multi-blockchain paradigm, initiatives in building Interoperability-Facilitating Platforms (IFPs) that aim at bridging different blockchains (a.k.a. blockchain interoperability) have come to the fore. Despite current efforts, it is extremely difficult for blockchain customers (organizations, governments, companies) to understand the trade-offs between different IFPs and their suitability for different application domains before adoption. A key reason is due to a lack of fundamental and systematic approaches to assess the variables among different IFPs. To fill this gap, developing new IFP requirements specification and open-source benchmark tools to advance research in distributed, multi-blockchain interoperability, with emphasis on IFP performance and security challenges are required. In this document, we outline a research proposal study to the community to realize this gap.",Blockchain,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.03866v1.pdf

However, the vulnerabilities in on-chain autonomous decision-makings and cumbersome off-chain coordination lead to serious concerns about blockchain's ability to behave in a trustworthy and efficient way. Blockchain governance has received considerable attention to support the decision-making process during the use and evolution of blockchain. Nevertheless, the conventional governance frameworks do not apply to blockchain due to its distributed architecture and decentralised decision process. These inherent features lead to the absence of a clear source of authority in blockchain ecosystem. Currently, there is a lack of systematic guidance on the governance of blockchain. Therefore, in this paper, we present a comprehensive blockchain governance framework, which elucidates an integrated view of the degree of decentralisation, decision rights, incentives, accountability, ecosystem, and legal and ethical responsibilities. The above aspects are formulated as six high-level principles for blockchain governance. We demonstrate a qualitative analysis of the proposed framework, including case studies on five extant blockchain platforms, and comparison with existing blockchain governance frameworks.

In the open-source software (OSS) portal GitHub, we observe a growing adoption of Blockchain-based solutions. Given the rapid emergence of Blockchain-based solutions in our daily life and the evolving cryptocurrency market, it is important to know the status quo, how developers generally interact in those repos, and how much freedom they have in applying code changes. We report an empirical study of 3,664 Blockchain software repositories from GitHub. We divide the Blockchain repositories into two categories: Tool (e.g., SDKs) and Applications (e.g., service/solutions developed using SDKs). The Application category is further divided into two sub-categories: Crypto and Non-Crypto applications. In all Blockchain repository categories, the contribution interactions on commits are the most common interaction type. We found that more organizations contributing to the Blockchain repos than individual users. The median numbers of internal and external users in tools are higher than the application repos. We observed a higher degree of collaboration (e.g., for maintenance efforts) among users in Blockchain tools than those in the application repos. Among the artifacts, issues have a greater number of interactions than commits and pull requests. Related to autonomy we found that less than half of total project contributions are autonomous.

Fernandez-Carames, Paula Fraga-Lamas","Blockchain and other Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs) have evolved significantly in the last years and their use has been suggested for numerous applications due to their ability to provide transparency, redundancy and accountability. In the case of blockchain, such characteristics are provided through public-key cryptography and hash functions. However, the fast progress of quantum computing has opened the possibility of performing attacks based on Grover's and Shor's algorithms in the near future. Such algorithms threaten both public-key cryptography and hash functions, forcing to redesign blockchains to make use of cryptosystems that withstand quantum attacks, thus creating which are known as post-quantum, quantum-proof, quantum-safe or quantum-resistant cryptosystems. For such a purpose, this article first studies current state of the art on post-quantum cryptosystems and how they can be applied to blockchains and DLTs. Moreover, the most relevant post-quantum blockchain systems are studied, as well as their main challenges.

Nevertheless, the proof-of-work based consensus protocols are vulnerable to cyber-attacks such as double-spending. In this paper, we propose a novel approach of cyber risk management for blockchain-based service. In particular, we adopt the cyber-insurance as an economic tool for neutralizing cyber risks due to attacks in blockchain networks. We consider a blockchain service market, which is composed of the infrastructure provider, the blockchain provider, the cyber-insurer, and the users. The blockchain provider purchases from the infrastructure provider, e.g., a cloud, the computing resources to maintain the blockchain consensus, and then offers blockchain services to the users. The blockchain provider strategizes its investment in the infrastructure and the service price charged to the users, in order to improve the security of the blockchain and thus optimize its profit. Meanwhile, the blockchain provider also purchases a cyber-insurance from the cyber-insurer to protect itself from the potential damage due to the attacks. In return, the cyber-insurer adjusts the insurance premium according to the perceived risk level of the blockchain service. Based on the assumption of rationality for the market entities, we model the interaction among the blockchain provider, the users, and the cyber-insurer as a two-level Stackelberg game. Namely, the blockchain provider and the cyber-insurer lead to set their pricing/investment strategies, and then the users follow to determine their demand of the blockchain service. Specifically, we consider the scenario of double-spending attacks and provide a series of analytical results about the Stackelberg equilibrium in the market game.",Blockchain,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.10412v2.pdf

Blockchain as a service (BaaS) is a promising solution to improve the productivity of blockchain application development. However, existing BaaS deployment solutions are mostly vendor-locked: they are either bound to a cloud provider or a blockchain platform. In addition to deployment, design and implementation of blockchain-based applications is a hard task requiring deep expertise. Therefore, this paper presents a unified blockchain as a service platform (uBaaS) to support both design and deployment of blockchain-based applications. The services in uBaaS include deployment as a service, design pattern as a service and auxiliary services. In uBaaS, deployment as a service is platform agnostic, which can avoid lock-in to specific cloud platforms, while design pattern as a service applies design patterns for data management and smart contract design to address the scalability and security issues of blockchain.

This paper concentrates on whether Bitcoin/blockchain can be considered a complex system and, if so, whether it is a chaotic one. Beyond mere academic curiosity, a positive response would raise concerns about the likelihood of Bitcoin/blockchain entering a 2010-Flash-Crash-type of chaotic regime, with catastrophic consequences for financial systems based on it. The paper starts by highlighting the relevant details of the Bitcoin/blockchain ecosystem formed by the blockchain itself, bitcoin end users (payers and payees), capital gains seekers, miners, full nodes maintainers, and developers, and their interactions. Then the Information Theory of Complex Systems is briefly discussed for later use. Finally, the blockchain is investigated with the help of Crutchfield's Statistical Complexity measure.

As enterprises begin to adopt blockchain technology to solve business problems, there are valid concerns if blockchain applications can support the transactional demands of production systems. In fact, the multiple distributed components and protocols that underlie blockchain applications makes performance optimization a non-trivial task. Blockchain performance optimization and scalability require a methodology to reduce complexity and cost. Furthermore, existing performance results often lack the requirements, load, and infrastructure of a production application. In this paper, we first develop a methodical approach to performance tuning enterprise blockchain applications to increase performance and transaction capacity. The methodology is applied to an enterprise blockchain-based application (leveraging Hyperledger Fabric) for performance tuning and optimization with the goal of bridging the gap between laboratory and production deployed system performance. We then present extensive results and analysis of our performance testing for on-premise and cloud deployments, in which we were able to scale the application from 30 to 3000 TPS without forking the Hyperledger Fabric source code and maintaining a reasonable infrastructure footprint. We also provide blockchain application and platform recommendations for performance improvement.",Blockchain,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.11456v1.pdf
2003.05687v1,Trends in Development of Databases and Blockchain,"Mayank Raikwar, Danilo Gligoroski, Goran Velinov","This work is about the mutual influence between two technologies: Databases and Blockchain. It addresses two questions: 1. How the database technology has influenced the development of blockchain technology?, and 2. How blockchain technology has influenced the introduction of new functionalities in some modern databases? For the first question, we explain how database technology contributes to blockchain technology by unlocking different features such as ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability) transactional consistency, rich queries, real-time analytics, and low latency. We explain how the CAP (Consistency, Availability, Partition tolerance) theorem known for databases influenced the DCS (Decentralization, Consistency, Scalability) theorem for the blockchain systems. By using an analogous relaxation approach as it was used for the proof of the CAP theorem, we postulate a ""DCS-satisfiability conjecture."" For the second question, we review different databases that are designed specifically for blockchain and provide most of the blockchain functionality like immutability, privacy, censorship resistance, along with database features.",Blockchain,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.05687v1.pdf
2004.01045v3,Topological Properties of Multi-Party Blockchain Transactions,Dongfang Zhao,"The cross-blockchain transaction remains one of the most challenging problems in blockchains. The root cause of the challenge lies in the nondeterministic nature of blockchains: A $n$-party transaction across multiple blockchains might be partially rolled back due to the potential forks in any of the participating blockchains---eventually, only one fork will survive in the competition among miners. While some effort has recently been made to developing hierarchically distributed commit protocols to make multi-party transactions progress, there is no systematic method to reason about the transaction outcome. This paper tackles this problem from a perspective of point-set topology. We construct multiple topological spaces for the transactions and blockchain forks, and show that these spaces are internally related through either homeomorphism or continuous functions. Combined together, these tools allow us to reason about the cross-blockchain transactions through the growing-fork topology, an intuitive representation of blockchains.",Blockchain,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.01045v3.pdf
2004.09494v4,Survey of Crosschain Communications Protocols,Peter Robinson,"Crosschain communications allows information to be communicated between blockchains. Consensus in the context of crosschain communications relates to how participants on one blockchain are convinced of the state of a remote blockchain. It describes how parties associated with a source blockchain come to agreement and communicate with a destination blockchain such that information from the source blockchain can be trusted. This paper surveys crosschain communications protocols, presenting them based on the top-level usage scenarios they are trying to meet: value swapping, crosschain messaging, and blockchain pinning. It analyses how each protocol achieves crosschain consensus, what trust assumptions are made, their ability to operate successfully in Permissionless and Permissioned blockchains contexts, and whether the protocol delivers atomic updates across blockchains.",Blockchain,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.09494v4.pdf

In this paper, we discuss the advantages of blockchain in steganography, which include the ability to embed hidden data without manual change in the original data, as well as the readiness of the blockchain platform for data transmission and storage, which eliminates the need for the Steganographer to design and implement a new platform for data transmission and storage. We have proposed two algorithms for steganography in blockchain, the first one is a high-capacity algorithm for the key and the steganography algorithm exchange and switching, and the second one is a medium-capacity algorithm for embedding hidden data. Also, by reviewing the previous three steganography schemes in blockchain, we have examined their drawback and have showed that none of them are practical schemes for steganography in blockchain. Then, we have explained the challenges of steganography in blockchain from the steganographers and steganalyzers point of view.",Blockchain,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.03103v1.pdf
2101.05495v1,Selective Deletion in a Blockchain,"Peter Hillmann, Marcus Knüpfer, Erik Heiland, Andreas Karcher","The constantly growing size of blockchains becomes a challenge with the increasing usage. Especially the storage of unwanted data in a blockchain is an issue, because it cannot be removed naturally. In order to counteract this problem, we present the first concept for the selective deletion of single entries in a blockchain. For this purpose, the general consensus algorithm is extended by the functionality of regularly creating summary blocks. Previous data of the chain are summarized and stored again in a new block, leaving out unwanted information. With a shifting marker of the Genesis Block, data can be deleted from the beginning of a blockchain. In this way, the technology of the blockchain becomes fully transactional. The concept is independent of a specific block structure, network structure, or consensus algorithm. Moreover, this functionality can be adapted to current blockchains to solve multiple problems related to scalability. This approach enables the transfer of blockchain technology to further fields of application, among others in the area of Industry 4.0 and Product Life-cycle Management.",Blockchain,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.05495v1.pdf

Such transactions allow not only funds to be transferred from one blockchain to another (as done in atomic swaps), but also a blockchain to verify the inclusion of any event on another blockchain. Cross-chain bridges are protocols that allow on-chain exchange of cryptocurrencies, on-chain transfer of assets to sidechains, and cross-shard verification of events in sharded blockchains, many of which rely on Byzantine fault tolerance (BFT) for scalability. Unfortunately, existing bridge protocols that can transfer funds from a BFT blockchain incur significant computation overhead on the destination blockchain, resulting in a high gas cost for smart contract verification of events. In this paper, we propose Horizon, a gas-efficient, cross-chain bridge protocol to transfer assets from a BFT blockchain to another blockchain (e.g., Ethereum) that supports basic smart contract execution.",Blockchain,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.06000v1.pdf

Permissioned blockchains are particularly enlightened by companies, enterprises, and government agencies due to their efficiency, customizability, and governance-friendly features. Obviously, seamlessly fusing blockchain and cloud computing can significantly benefit permissioned blockchains; nevertheless, most blockchains implemented on clouds are originally designed for loosely-coupled networks where nodes communicate asynchronously, failing to take advantages of the closely-coupled nature of cloud servers. In this paper, we propose an innovative cloud-oriented blockchain -- CloudChain, which is a modularized three-layer system composed of the network layer, consensus layer, and blockchain layer. CloudChain is based on a shared-memory model where nodes communicate synchronously by direct memory accesses. We realize the shared-memory model with the Remote Direct Memory Access technology, based on which we propose a shared-memory consensus algorithm to ensure presistence and liveness, the two crucial blockchain security properties countering Byzantine nodes. We also implement a CloudChain prototype based on a RoCEv2-based testbed to experimentally validate our design, and the results verify the feasibility and efficiency of CloudChain.",Blockchain,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.04122v1.pdf

The cyber-physical systems (CPS) is one of the prominent application domains that leverage blockchain for myriad operations, where the Internet of Things (IoT) is utilized for data collection. Although some of the CPS problems can be solved by simply adopting blockchain for its secure and distributed nature, others require complex considerations for overcoming blockchain-imposed limitations while maintaining the core aspect of CPS. Even though a number of studies focus on either the utilization of blockchains for different CPS applications or the blockchain-enabled security of CPS, there is no comprehensive survey including both perspectives together. To fill this gap, we present a comprehensive overview of contemporary advancement in using blockchain for enhancing different CPS operations as well as improving CPS security. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper that presents an in-depth review of research on blockchain-enabled CPS operation and security.",Blockchain,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.07916v1.pdf

Using patterns is a common practice for software architects to ensure software quality. Many pattern collections have been proposed for a large number of application domains. However, because of the technology's recentness, there are only a few available collections with a lack of extensive testing in industrial blockchain applications. It is also difficult for software architects to adequately apply blockchain patterns in their applications, as it requires deep knowledge of blockchain technology. Through a systematic literature review, this paper has identified 120 unique blockchain-related patterns and proposes a pattern taxonomy composed of multiple categories, built from the extracted pattern collection. The purpose of this collection is to map, classify, and describe all available patterns across the literature to help readers make adequate decisions regarding blockchain pattern selection. This study also shows potential applications of those patterns and identifies the relationships between blockchain patterns and other non-blockchain software patterns.",Blockchain,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.04374v1.pdf

To the best of our knowledge, there is no Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) that gives a complete picture of the existing cryptographic concepts which have been deployed or have the potential to be deployed in blockchain. In this paper, we thoroughly review and systematize all cryptographic concepts which are already used in blockchain. Additionally, we give a list of cryptographic concepts which have not yet been applied but have big potentials to improve the current blockchain solutions. We also include possible instantiations of these cryptographic concepts in the blockchain domain.

Lalitha, Vaneet Aggarwal","Blockchain is a distributed ledger with wide applications. Due to the increasing storage requirement for blockchains, the computation can be afforded by only a few miners. Sharding has been proposed to scale blockchains so that storage and transaction efficiency of the blockchain improves at the cost of security guarantee. This paper aims to consider a new protocol, Secure-Repair-Blockchain (SRB), which aims to decrease the storage cost at the miners. In addition, SRB also decreases the bootstrapping cost, which allows for new miners to easily join a sharded blockchain. In order to reduce storage, coding-theoretic techniques are used in SRB. In order to decrease the amount of data that is transferred to the new node joining a shard, the concept of exact repair secure regenerating codes is used. The proposed blockchain protocol achieves lower storage than those that do not use coding, and achieves lower bootstrapping cost as compared to the different baselines.",Blockchain,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.06201v1.pdf
2012.04172v1,When Services Computing Meets Blockchain: Challenges and Opportunities,"Xiaoyun Li, Zibin Zheng, Hong-Ning Dai","Services computing can offer a high-level abstraction to support diverse applications via encapsulating various computing infrastructures. Though services computing has greatly boosted the productivity of developers, it is faced with three main challenges: privacy and security risks, information silo, and pricing mechanisms and incentives. The recent advances of blockchain bring opportunities to address the challenges of services computing due to its build-in encryption as well as digital signature schemes, decentralization feature, and intrinsic incentive mechanisms. In this paper, we present a survey to investigate the integration of blockchain with services computing. The integration of blockchain with services computing mainly exhibits merits in two aspects: i) blockchain can potentially address key challenges of services computing and ii) services computing can also promote blockchain development. In particular, we categorize the current literature of services computing based on blockchain into five types: services creation, services discovery, services recommendation, services composition, and services arbitration. Moreover, we generalize Blockchain as a Service (BaaS) architecture and summarize the representative BaaS platforms. In addition, we also outline open issues of blockchain-based services computing and BaaS.",Blockchain,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.04172v1.pdf

Blockchain facilitates fast, secure, and cross-border payments without the need for intermediaries such as banks. Because blockchain technology is still emerging, systematically organised knowledge providing a holistic and comprehensive view on designing payment applications that use blockchain is yet to be established. If such knowledge could be established in the form of a set of blockchain-specific patterns, architects could use those patterns in designing a payment application that leverages blockchain. Therefore, in this paper, we first identify a token's lifecycle and then present 12 patterns that cover critical aspects in enabling the state transitions of a token in blockchain-based payment applications. The lifecycle and the annotated patterns provide a payment-focused systematic view of system interactions and a guide to effective use of the patterns.",Blockchain,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.09810v3.pdf
2104.05849v2,Reward Mechanism for Blockchains Using Evolutionary Game Theory,"Shashank Motepalli, Hans-Arno Jacobsen","Blockchains have witnessed widespread adoption in the past decade in various fields. The growing demand makes their scalability and sustainability challenges more evident than ever. As a result, more and more blockchains have begun to adopt proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus protocols to address those challenges. One of the fundamental characteristics of any blockchain technology is its crypto-economics and incentives. Lately, each PoS blockchain has designed a unique reward mechanism, yet, many of them are prone to free-rider and nothing-at-stake problems. To better understand the ad-hoc design of reward mechanisms, in this paper, we develop a reward mechanism framework that could apply to many PoS blockchains. We formulate the block validation game wherein the rewards are distributed for validating the blocks correctly. Using evolutionary game theory, we analyze how the participants' behaviour could potentially evolve with the reward mechanism. Also, penalties are found to play a central role in maintaining the integrity of blockchains.",Blockchain,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.05849v2.pdf

In a BDI model we formalize basic assumptions about dialog and cooperative behaviour of participants. These assumptions provide a basis for inferring speech acts from coherence relations between utterances and attitudes of dialog participants. Speech acts prove to be useful for determining dialog segments defined on the notion of completing expectations of dialog participants. Finally, we sketch how explicit segmentation signalled by cue phrases and performatives is covered by our dialog model.",NLP,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9809022v1.pdf

9809026v1,Prefix Probabilities from Stochastic Tree Adjoining Grammars,"Mark-Jan Nederhof, Anoop Sarkar, Giorgio Satta","Language models for speech recognition typically use a probability model of the form Pr(a_n | a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n-1}). Stochastic grammars, on the other hand, are typically used to assign structure to utterances. A language model of the above form is constructed from such grammars by computing the prefix probability Sum_{w in Sigma*} Pr(a_1 ... a_n w), where w represents all possible terminations of the prefix a_1 ... a_n. The main result in this paper is an algorithm to compute such prefix probabilities given a stochastic Tree Adjoining Grammar (TAG). The algorithm achieves the required computation in O(n^6) time. The probability of subderivations that do not derive any words in the prefix, but contribute structurally to its derivation, are precomputed to achieve termination. This algorithm enables existing corpus-based estimation techniques for stochastic TAGs to be used for language modelling.",NLP,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9809026v1.pdf
9809027v1,Conditions on Consistency of Probabilistic Tree Adjoining Grammars,Anoop Sarkar,"Much of the power of probabilistic methods in modelling language comes from their ability to compare several derivations for the same string in the language. An important starting point for the study of such cross-derivational properties is the notion of _consistency_. The probability model defined by a probabilistic grammar is said to be _consistent_ if the probabilities assigned to all the strings in the language sum to one. From the literature on probabilistic context-free grammars (CFGs), we know precisely the conditions which ensure that consistency is true for a given CFG. This paper derives the conditions under which a given probabilistic Tree Adjoining Grammar (TAG) can be shown to be consistent. It gives a simple algorithm for checking consistency and gives the formal justification for its correctness. The conditions derived here can be used to ensure that probability models that use TAGs can be checked for _deficiency_ (i.e. whether any probability mass is assigned to strings that cannot be generated).",NLP,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9809027v1.pdf

Using LSTAG we define an approach towards coordination where linguistic dependency is distinguished from the notion of constituency. Such an approach towards coordination that explicitly distinguishes dependencies from constituency gives a better formal understanding of its representation when compared to previous approaches that use tree-rewriting systems which conflate the two issues.,NLP,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9809028v1.pdf

We employ a gradual, information-based concept of ``unknownness'' providing a uniform treatment for the range of completely known to maximally unknown lexical entries. ``Unknown'' information is viewed as revisable information, which is either generalizable or specializable. Updating takes place after parsing, which only requires a modified lexical lookup. Revisable pieces of information are identified by grammar-specified declarations which provide access paths into the parse feature structure. The updating mechanism revises the corresponding places in the lexical feature structures iff the context actually provides new information. For revising generalizable information, type union is required. A worked-out example demonstrates the inferential capacity of our implemented system.",NLP,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9809106v1.pdf

For generation and parsing of word forms, I propose a novel off-line technique to eliminate run-time optimization. It produces a finite-state oracle that efficiently restricts the constraint interpreter's search space. As a byproduct, unknown words can be analyzed without special mechanisms. Unlike pure finite-state transducer approaches, this hybrid setup allows for more expressivity in constraints to specify e.g. token identity for reduplication or arithmetic constraints for phonetics.",NLP,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9809107v1.pdf

We used the same training corpus (and therefore the same tag-set) to train both taggers. We then applied the taggers to the same test corpus and compared their respective behavior and in particular their error rates. Both taggers perform similarly with an error rate of around 5%. From the detailed error analysis it can be seen that the rule-based tagger has more problems with unknown words than the statistical tagger. But the results are opposite for tokens that are many-ways ambiguous. If the unknown words are fed into the taggers with the help of an external lexicon (such as the Gertwol system) the error rate of the rule-based tagger drops to 4.7%, and the respective rate of the statistical taggers drops to around 3.7%.

(2) viewing each subproblem as that of statistical estimation and defining probability models for each subproblem, (3) adopting the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle as learning strategy, (4) employing efficient learning algorithms, and (5) viewing the disambiguation problem as that of statistical prediction. Major contributions of this thesis include: (1) formalization of the lexical knowledge acquisition problem, (2) development of a number of learning methods for lexical knowledge acquisition, and (3) development of a high-performance disambiguation method.",NLP,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9812001v3.pdf
9812005v1,Optimal Multi-Paragraph Text Segmentation by Dynamic Programming,Oskari Heinonen,"There exist several methods of calculating a similarity curve, or a sequence of similarity values, representing the lexical cohesion of successive text constituents, e.g., paragraphs. Methods for deciding the locations of fragment boundaries are, however, scarce. We propose a fragmentation method based on dynamic programming. The method is theoretically sound and guaranteed to provide an optimal splitting on the basis of a similarity curve, a preferred fragment length, and a cost function defined. The method is especially useful when control on fragment size is of importance.",NLP,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9812005v1.pdf
9812018v1,A Flexible Shallow Approach to Text Generation,"Stephan Busemann, Helmut Horacek","In order to support the efficient development of NL generation systems, two orthogonal methods are currently pursued with emphasis: (1) reusable, general, and linguistically motivated surface realization components, and (2) simple, task-oriented template-based techniques. In this paper we argue that, from an application-oriented perspective, the benefits of both are still limited. In order to improve this situation, we suggest and evaluate shallow generation methods associated with increased flexibility. We advise a close connection between domain-motivated and linguistic ontologies that supports the quick adaptation to new tasks and domains, rather than the reuse of general resources. Our method is especially designed for generating reports with limited linguistic variations.",NLP,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9812018v1.pdf

McKeever","Scheduling dialogs, during which people negotiate the times of appointments, are common in everyday life. This paper reports the results of an in-depth empirical investigation of resolving explicit temporal references in scheduling dialogs. There are four phases of this work: data annotation and evaluation, model development, system implementation and evaluation, and model evaluation and analysis. The system and model were developed primarily on one set of data, and then applied later to a much more complex data set, to assess the generalizability of the model for the task being performed. Many different types of empirical methods are applied to pinpoint the strengths and weaknesses of the approach. Detailed annotation instructions were developed and an intercoder reliability study was performed, showing that naive annotators can reliably perform the targeted annotations. A fully automatic system has been developed and evaluated on unseen test data, with good results on both data sets. We adopt a pure realization of a recency-based focus model to identify precisely when it is and is not adequate for the task being addressed. In addition to system results, an in-depth evaluation of the model itself is presented, based on detailed manual annotations. The results are that few errors occur specifically due to the model of focus being used, and the set of anaphoric relations defined in the model are low in ambiguity for both data sets.",NLP,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9901005v1.pdf
9902001v1,Compacting the Penn Treebank Grammar,"Alexander Krotov, Mark Hepple, Robert Gaizauskas, Yorick Wilks","Treebanks, such as the Penn Treebank (PTB), offer a simple approach to obtaining a broad coverage grammar: one can simply read the grammar off the parse trees in the treebank. While such a grammar is easy to obtain, a square-root rate of growth of the rule set with corpus size suggests that the derived grammar is far from complete and that much more treebanked text would be required to obtain a complete grammar, if one exists at some limit. However, we offer an alternative explanation in terms of the underspecification of structures within the treebank. This hypothesis is explored by applying an algorithm to compact the derived grammar by eliminating redundant rules -- rules whose right hand sides can be parsed by other rules. The size of the resulting compacted grammar, which is significantly less than that of the full treebank grammar, is shown to approach a limit. However, such a compacted grammar does not yield very good performance figures. A version of the compaction algorithm taking rule probabilities into account is proposed, which is argued to be more linguistically motivated. Combined with simple thresholding, this method can be used to give a 58% reduction in grammar size without significant change in parsing performance, and can produce a 69% reduction with some gain in recall, but a loss in precision.",NLP,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9902001v1.pdf
9902029v1,"The ""Fodor""-FODOR fallacy bites back",Yorick Wilks,"The paper argues that Fodor and Lepore are misguided in their attack on Pustejovsky's Generative Lexicon, largely because their argument rests on a traditional, but implausible and discredited, view of the lexicon on which it is effectively empty of content, a view that stands in the long line of explaining word meaning (a) by ostension and then (b) explaining it by means of a vacuous symbol in a lexicon, often the word itself after typographic transmogrification. (a) and (b) both share the wrong belief that to a word must correspond a simple entity that is its meaning. I then turn to the semantic rules that Pustejovsky uses and argue first that, although they have novel features, they are in a well-established Artificial Intelligence tradition of explaining meaning by reference to structures that mention other structures assigned to words that may occur in close proximity to the first. It is argued that Fodor and Lepore's view that there cannot be such rules is without foundation, and indeed systems using such rules have proved their practical worth in computational systems. Their justification descends from line of argument, whose high points were probably Wittgenstein and Quine that meaning is not to be understood by simple links to the world, ostensive or otherwise, but by the relationship of whole cultural representational structures to each other and to the world as a whole.",NLP,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9902029v1.pdf

9903003v1,A Formal Framework for Linguistic Annotation,"Steven Bird, Mark Liberman","`Linguistic annotation' covers any descriptive or analytic notations applied to raw language data. The basic data may be in the form of time functions -- audio, video and/or physiological recordings -- or it may be textual. The added notations may include transcriptions of all sorts (from phonetic features to discourse structures), part-of-speech and sense tagging, syntactic analysis, `named entity' identification, co-reference annotation, and so on. While there are several ongoing efforts to provide formats and tools for such annotations and to publish annotated linguistic databases, the lack of widely accepted standards is becoming a critical problem. Proposed standards, to the extent they exist, have focussed on file formats. This paper focuses instead on the logical structure of linguistic annotations. We survey a wide variety of existing annotation formats and demonstrate a common conceptual core, the annotation graph. This provides a formal framework for constructing, maintaining and searching linguistic annotations, while remaining consistent with many alternative data structures and file formats.",NLP,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9903003v1.pdf
9903008v1,Empirically Evaluating an Adaptable Spoken Dialogue System,"Diane J. Litman, Shimei Pan","Recent technological advances have made it possible to build real-time, interactive spoken dialogue systems for a wide variety of applications. However, when users do not respect the limitations of such systems, performance typically degrades. Although users differ with respect to their knowledge of system limitations, and although different dialogue strategies make system limitations more apparent to users, most current systems do not try to improve performance by adapting dialogue behavior to individual users. This paper presents an empirical evaluation of TOOT, an adaptable spoken dialogue system for retrieving train schedules on the web. We conduct an experiment in which 20 users carry out 4 tasks with both adaptable and non-adaptable versions of TOOT, resulting in a corpus of 80 dialogues. The values for a wide range of evaluation measures are then extracted from this corpus. Our results show that adaptable TOOT generally outperforms non-adaptable TOOT, and that the utility of adaptation depends on TOOT's initial dialogue strategies.",NLP,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9903008v1.pdf

Belief modelling is the development of techniques to represent the mental attitudes of a dialogue participant. The latter approach, speech act processing, based on speech act theory, involves viewing dialogue in planning terms. Utterances in a dialogue are modelled as steps in a plan where understanding an utterance involves deriving the complete plan a speaker is attempting to achieve. However, previous speech act based approaches have been limited by a reliance upon relatively simplistic belief modelling techniques and their relationship to planning and plan recognition. In particular, such techniques assume precomputed nested belief structures. In this paper, we will present an approach to speech act processing based on novel belief modelling techniques where nested beliefs are propagated on demand.",NLP,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9904009v1.pdf

It describes the operation and output of LOQ, a text-to-speech implementation that includes a model of limited attention and working memory. Attentional limitations are key. Varying the attentional parameter in the simulations varies in turn what counts as given and new in a text, and therefore, the intonational contours with which it is uttered. Currently, the system produces prosody in three different styles: child-like, adult expressive, and knowledgeable. This prosody also exhibits differences within each style -- no two simulations are alike. The limited resource approach captures some of the stylistic and individual variety found in natural prosody.",NLP,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9904018v1.pdf

Unfortunately, the cost of building large annotated corpora is prohibitively expensive. This work aims to improve the induction strategy when there are few labels in the training data. We show that the most informative linguistic constituents are the higher nodes in the parse trees, typically denoting complex noun phrases and sentential clauses. They account for only 20% of all constituents. For inducing grammars from sparsely labeled training data (e.g., only higher-level constituent labels), we propose an adaptation strategy, which produces grammars that parse almost as well as grammars induced from fully labeled corpora. Our results suggest that for a partial parser to replace human annotators, it must be able to automatically extract higher-level constituents rather than base noun phrases.",NLP,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9905001v1.pdf
9906003v1,The syntactic processing of particles in Japanese spoken language,Melanie Siegel,"Particles fullfill several distinct central roles in the Japanese language. They can mark arguments as well as adjuncts, can be functional or have semantic funtions. There is, however, no straightforward matching from particles to functions, as, e.g., GA can mark the subject, the object or an adjunct of a sentence. Particles can cooccur. Verbal arguments that could be identified by particles can be eliminated in the Japanese sentence. And finally, in spoken language particles are often omitted. A proper treatment of particles is thus necessary to make an analysis of Japanese sentences possible. Our treatment is based on an empirical investigation of 800 dialogues. We set up a type hierarchy of particles motivated by their subcategorizational and modificational behaviour. This type hierarchy is part of the Japanese syntax in VERBMOBIL.",NLP,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9906003v1.pdf

An algorithm to translate from TOP to the TSQL2 temporal database language has also been defined. This paper shows how TOP expressions could be translated into a simpler logic-like language, called BOT.

These `annotation graphs' offer a simple yet powerful method for representing complex annotation structures incorporating hierarchy and overlap. Here, we motivate and illustrate our approach using discourse-level annotations of text and speech data drawn from the CALLHOME, COCONUT, MUC-7, DAMSL and TRAINS annotation schemes. With the help of domain specialists, we have constructed a hybrid multi-level annotation for a fragment of the Boston University Radio Speech Corpus which includes the following levels: segment, word, breath, ToBI, Tilt, Treebank, coreference and named entity. We show how annotation graphs can represent hybrid multi-level structures which derive from a diverse set of file formats. We also show how the approach facilitates substantive comparison of multiple annotations of a single signal based on different theoretical models. The discussion shows how annotation graphs open the door to wide-ranging integration of tools, formats and corpora.",NLP,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9907003v1.pdf

Our system first translates a given query containing technical terms into the target language, and then retrieves documents relevant to the translated query. The translation of technical terms is still problematic in that technical terms are often compound words, and thus new terms can be progressively created simply by combining existing base words. In addition, Japanese often represents loanwords based on its phonogram. Consequently, existing dictionaries find it difficult to achieve sufficient coverage. To counter the first problem, we use a compound word translation method, which uses a bilingual dictionary for base words and collocational statistics to resolve translation ambiguity. For the second problem, we propose a transliteration method, which identifies phonetic equivalents in the target language. We also show the effectiveness of our system using a test collection for CLIR.",NLP,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9907007v2.pdf

Templates are skeletal LTRs, unspecified for words. New LTRs are created by instantiating a template with words, provided that the words belong to the appropriate lexical categories required by the template. We define two methods for creating an inventory of templates and using them to generate new LTRs. A simpler method consists of extracting a finite set of templates from a sample of hand coded LTRs and directly using them in the generation process. A further method consists of abstracting over the initial finite set of templates to define higher level templates, where bilingual equivalences are defined in terms of correspondences involving phrasal categories. Phrasal templates are then mapped onto sets of lexical templates with the aid of grammars. In this way an infinite set of lexical templates is recursively defined. New LTRs are created by parsing input words, matching a template at the phrasal level and using the corresponding lexical categories to instantiate the lexical template. The definition of an infinite set of templates enables the automatic creation of LTRs for multi-word, non-compositional word equivalences of any cardinality.",NLP,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9907017v1.pdf

To construct a database of practical size, a considerable overhead for manual sense disambiguation (overhead for supervision) is required. In addition, the time complexity of searching a large-sized database poses a considerable problem (overhead for search). To counter these problems, our method selectively samples a smaller-sized effective subset from a given example set for use in word sense disambiguation. Our method is characterized by the reliance on the notion of training utility: the degree to which each example is informative for future example sampling when used for the training of the system. The system progressively collects examples by selecting those with greatest utility. The paper reports the effectiveness of our method through experiments on about one thousand sentences. Compared to experiments with other example sampling methods, our method reduced both the overhead for supervision and the overhead for search, without the degeneration of the performance of the system.",NLP,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9910020v1.pdf

9911011v1,One-Level Prosodic Morphology,Markus Walther,"Recent developments in theoretical linguistics have lead to a widespread acceptance of constraint-based analyses of prosodic morphology phenomena such as truncation, infixation, floating morphemes and reduplication. Of these, reduplication is particularly challenging for state-of-the-art computational morphology, since it involves copying of some part of a phonological string. In this paper I argue for certain extensions to the one-level model of phonology and morphology (Bird & Ellison 1994) to cover the computational aspects of prosodic morphology using finite-state methods. In a nutshell, enriched lexical representations provide additional automaton arcs to repeat or skip sounds and also to allow insertion of additional material. A kind of resource consciousness is introduced to control this additional freedom, distinguishing between producer and consumer arcs. The non-finite-state copying aspect of reduplication is mapped to automata intersection, itself a non-finite-state operation. Bounded local optimization prunes certain automaton arcs that fail to contribute to linguistic optimisation criteria. The paper then presents implemented case studies of Ulwa construct state infixation, German hypocoristic truncation and Tagalog over-applying reduplication that illustrate the expressive power of this approach, before its merits and limitations are discussed and possible extensions are sketched. I conclude that the one-level approach to prosodic morphology presents an attractive way of extending finite-state techniques to difficult phenomena that hitherto resisted elegant computational analyses.",NLP,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9911011v1.pdf
9912003v1,Resolution of Indirect Anaphora in Japanese Sentences Using Examples 'X   no Y (Y of X)',"M. Murata, H. Isahara, M. Nagao","A noun phrase can indirectly refer to an entity that has already been mentioned. For example, ``I went into an old house last night. The roof was leaking badly and ...'' indicates that ``the roof'' is associated with `` an old house}'', which was mentioned in the previous sentence. This kind of reference (indirect anaphora) has not been studied well in natural language processing, but is important for coherence resolution, language understanding, and machine translation. In order to analyze indirect anaphora, we need a case frame dictionary for nouns that contains knowledge of the relationships between two nouns but no such dictionary presently exists. Therefore, we are forced to use examples of ``X no Y'' (Y of X) and a verb case frame dictionary instead. We tried estimating indirect anaphora using this information and obtained a recall rate of 63% and a precision rate of 68% on test sentences. This indicates that the information of ``X no Y'' is useful to a certain extent when we cannot make use of a noun case frame dictionary. We estimated the results that would be given by a noun case frame dictionary, and obtained recall and precision rates of 71% and 82% respectively. Finally, we proposed a way to construct a noun case frame dictionary by using examples of ``X no Y.''",NLP,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9912003v1.pdf

We also propose many new methods for estimating referents of pronouns. For example, we use the form ``X of Y'' for estimating referents of demonstrative adjectives. In addition to our new methods, we used many conventional methods.

9912005v1,An Estimate of Referent of Noun Phrases in Japanese Sentences,"M. Murata, M. Nagao","In machine translation and man-machine dialogue, it is important to clarify referents of noun phrases. We present a method for determining the referents of noun phrases in Japanese sentences by using the referential properties, modifiers, and possessors of noun phrases. Since the Japanese language has no articles, it is difficult to decide whether a noun phrase has an antecedent or not. We had previously estimated the referential properties of noun phrases that correspond to articles by using clue words in the sentences. By using these referential properties, our system determined the referents of noun phrases in Japanese sentences. Furthermore we used the modifiers and possessors of noun phrases in determining the referents of noun phrases.

It is less ambitious than full-fledged question answering in that the answers are not generated from a knowledge base but looked up in the text of documents. The current version of ExtrAns is able to parse unedited Unix ""man pages"", and derive the logical form of their sentences. User queries are also translated into logical forms.

An answer extraction system locates the exact phrases in the documents that contain the explicit answers to the user queries. Answer extraction systems are therefore more convenient than document retrieval systems in situations where the user wants to find specific information in limited time.   ExtrAns performs answer extraction over UNIX manpages. It has been constructed by combining available linguistic resources and implementing only a few modules from scratch. A resolution procedure between the minimal logical form of the user query and the minimal logical forms of the manpage sentences finds the answers to the queries. These answers are displayed to the user, together with pointers to the respective manpages, and the exact phrases that contribute to the answer are highlighted.   This paper shows that the increase in response times is not a big issue when scaling the system up from 30 to 500 documents, and that the response times for 500 documents are still acceptable for a real-time answer extraction system.",NLP,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0005019v1.pdf

Henderson,"The popularity of applying machine learning methods to computational linguistics problems has produced a large supply of trainable natural language processing systems. Most problems of interest have an array of off-the-shelf products or downloadable code implementing solutions using various techniques. Where these solutions are developed independently, it is observed that their errors tend to be independently distributed. This thesis is concerned with approaches for capitalizing on this situation in a sample problem domain, Penn Treebank-style parsing.   The machine learning community provides techniques for combining outputs of classifiers, but parser output is more structured and interdependent than classifications. To address this discrepancy, two novel strategies for combining parsers are used: learning to control a switch between parsers and constructing a hybrid parse from multiple parsers' outputs.   Off-the-shelf parsers are not developed with an intention to perform well in a collaborative ensemble. Two techniques are presented for producing an ensemble of parsers that collaborate. All of the ensemble members are created using the same underlying parser induction algorithm, and the method for producing complementary parsers is only loosely constrained by that chosen algorithm.",NLP,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0006012v1.pdf

At each stage of the translation process, an input is transformed into an output, producing as a byproduct a ""meta-output"" which describes the nature of the transformation performed.

0006020v1,A Comparison of the XTAG and CLE Grammars for English,"Beth Ann Hockey, Manny Rayner, Frankie James","When people develop something intended as a large broad-coverage grammar, they usually have a more specific goal in mind. Sometimes this goal is covering a corpus; sometimes the developers have theoretical ideas they wish to investigate; most often, work is driven by a combination of these two main types of goal. What tends to happen after a while is that the community of people working with the grammar starts thinking of some phenomena as ``central'', and makes serious efforts to deal with them; other phenomena are labelled ``marginal'', and ignored. Before long, the distinction between ``central'' and ``marginal'' becomes so ingrained that it is automatic, and people virtually stop thinking about the ``marginal'' phenomena. In practice, the only way to bring the marginal things back into focus is to look at what other people are doing and compare it with one's own work. In this paper, we will take two large grammars, XTAG and the CLE, and examine each of them from the other's point of view. We will find in both cases not only that important things are missing, but that the perspective offered by the other grammar suggests simple and practical ways of filling in the holes. It turns out that there is a pleasing symmetry to the picture. XTAG has a very good treatment of complement structure, which the CLE to some extent lacks; conversely, the CLE offers a powerful and general account of adjuncts, which the XTAG grammar does not fully duplicate. If we examine the way in which each grammar does the thing it is good at, we find that the relevant methods are quite easy to port to the other framework, and in fact only involve generalization and systematization of existing mechanisms.",NLP,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0006020v1.pdf

Van Ess-Dykema, M. Meteer","We describe a statistical approach for modeling dialogue acts in conversational speech, i.e., speech-act-like units such as Statement, Question, Backchannel, Agreement, Disagreement, and Apology. Our model detects and predicts dialogue acts based on lexical, collocational, and prosodic cues, as well as on the discourse coherence of the dialogue act sequence. The dialogue model is based on treating the discourse structure of a conversation as a hidden Markov model and the individual dialogue acts as observations emanating from the model states. Constraints on the likely sequence of dialogue acts are modeled via a dialogue act n-gram. The statistical dialogue grammar is combined with word n-grams, decision trees, and neural networks modeling the idiosyncratic lexical and prosodic manifestations of each dialogue act. We develop a probabilistic integration of speech recognition with dialogue modeling, to improve both speech recognition and dialogue act classification accuracy. Models are trained and evaluated using a large hand-labeled database of 1,155 conversations from the Switchboard corpus of spontaneous human-to-human telephone speech. We achieved good dialogue act labeling accuracy (65% based on errorful, automatically recognized words and prosody, and 71% based on word transcripts, compared to a chance baseline accuracy of 35% and human accuracy of 84%) and a small reduction in word recognition error.",NLP,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0006023v2.pdf

Meteer, C. Van Ess-Dykema","Identifying whether an utterance is a statement, question, greeting, and so forth is integral to effective automatic understanding of natural dialog. Little is known, however, about how such dialog acts (DAs) can be automatically classified in truly natural conversation. This study asks whether current approaches, which use mainly word information, could be improved by adding prosodic information. The study is based on more than 1000 conversations from the Switchboard corpus. DAs were hand-annotated, and prosodic features (duration, pause, F0, energy, and speaking rate) were automatically extracted for each DA. In training, decision trees based on these features were inferred; trees were then applied to unseen test data to evaluate performance. Performance was evaluated for prosody models alone, and after combining the prosody models with word information -- either from true words or from the output of an automatic speech recognizer. For an overall classification task, as well as three subtasks, prosody made significant contributions to classification. Feature-specific analyses further revealed that although canonical features (such as F0 for questions) were important, less obvious features could compensate if canonical features were removed. Finally, in each task, integrating the prosodic model with a DA-specific statistical language model improved performance over that of the language model alone, especially for the case of recognized words. Results suggest that DAs are redundantly marked in natural conversation, and that a variety of automatically extractable prosodic features could aid dialog processing in speech applications.",NLP,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0006024v1.pdf
0006025v1,Entropy-based Pruning of Backoff Language Models,A. Stolcke,"A criterion for pruning parameters from N-gram backoff language models is developed, based on the relative entropy between the original and the pruned model. It is shown that the relative entropy resulting from pruning a single N-gram can be computed exactly and efficiently for backoff models. The relative entropy measure can be expressed as a relative change in training set perplexity. This leads to a simple pruning criterion whereby all N-grams that change perplexity by less than a threshold are removed from the model. Experiments show that a production-quality Hub4 LM can be reduced to 26% its original size without increasing recognition error. We also compare the approach to a heuristic pruning criterion by Seymore and Rosenfeld (1996), and show that their approach can be interpreted as an approximation to the relative entropy criterion. Experimentally, both approaches select similar sets of N-grams (about 85% overlap), with the exact relative entropy criterion giving marginally better performance.",NLP,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0006025v1.pdf

All systems attempt to produce a grammatical natural language phrase from a domain-specific semantic representation. NLG1 serves a baseline system and uses phrase frequencies to generate a whole phrase in one step, while NLG2 and NLG3 use maximum entropy probability models to individually generate each word in the phrase.

Tur","A crucial step in processing speech audio data for information extraction, topic detection, or browsing/playback is to segment the input into sentence and topic units. Speech segmentation is challenging, since the cues typically present for segmenting text (headers, paragraphs, punctuation) are absent in spoken language. We investigate the use of prosody (information gleaned from the timing and melody of speech) for these tasks. Using decision tree and hidden Markov modeling techniques, we combine prosodic cues with word-based approaches, and evaluate performance on two speech corpora, Broadcast News and Switchboard. Results show that the prosodic model alone performs on par with, or better than, word-based statistical language models -- for both true and automatically recognized words in news speech. The prosodic model achieves comparable performance with significantly less training data, and requires no hand-labeling of prosodic events. Across tasks and corpora, we obtain a significant improvement over word-only models using a probabilistic combination of prosodic and lexical information. Inspection reveals that the prosodic models capture language-independent boundary indicators described in the literature. Finally, cue usage is task and corpus dependent. For example, pause and pitch features are highly informative for segmenting news speech, whereas pause, duration and word-based cues dominate for natural conversation.",NLP,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0006036v1.pdf

This model is then generalized to encompass a wider variety of linguistic ``signals,'' including both naturally occuring phenomena (as recorded in images, video, multi-modal interactions, etc.), as well as the derived resources that are increasingly important to the engineering of natural language processing systems (such as word lists, dictionaries, aligned bilingual corpora, etc.). We conclude with a review of the current efforts towards implementing key pieces of this architecture.",NLP,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0007022v1.pdf
0007024v1,"Many uses, many annotations for large speech corpora: Switchboard and   TDT as case studies","David Graff, Steven Bird","This paper discusses the challenges that arise when large speech corpora receive an ever-broadening range of diverse and distinct annotations. Two case studies of this process are presented: the Switchboard Corpus of telephone conversations and the TDT2 corpus of broadcast news. Switchboard has undergone two independent transcriptions and various types of additional annotation, all carried out as separate projects that were dispersed both geographically and chronologically. The TDT2 corpus has also received a variety of annotations, but all directly created or managed by a core group. In both cases, issues arise involving the propagation of repairs, consistency of references, and the ability to integrate annotations having different formats and levels of detail. We describe a general framework whereby these issues can be addressed successfully.",NLP,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0007024v1.pdf

However, for controlled systems, new features are needed to distinguish between information generated by the system and input control. We show how the modelling framework for controlled dynamical systems leads naturally to a formulation in terms of context-dependent grammars. A learning algorithm is proposed for on-line generation of the grammar productions, this formulation being then used for modelling, control and anomaly detection. Practical applications are described for electromechanical drives. Grammatical interpolation techniques yield accurate results and the pattern detection capabilities of the language-based formulation makes it a promising technique for the early detection of anomalies or faulty behaviour.",NLP,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0007036v1.pdf
0008003v1,Interfacing Constraint-Based Grammars and Generation Algorithms,Stephan Busemann,"Constraint-based grammars can, in principle, serve as the major linguistic knowledge source for both parsing and generation. Surface generation starts from input semantics representations that may vary across grammars. For many declarative grammars, the concept of derivation implicitly built in is that of parsing. They may thus not be interpretable by a generation algorithm. We show that linguistically plausible semantic analyses can cause severe problems for semantic-head-driven approaches for generation (SHDG). We use SeReal, a variant of SHDG and the DISCO grammar of German as our source of examples. We propose a new, general approach that explicitly accounts for the interface between the grammar and the generation algorithm by adding a control-oriented layer to the linguistic knowledge base that reorganizes the semantics in a way suitable for generation.",NLP,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0008003v1.pdf

Therefore, one may often only have time to obtain a small training corpus with the desired GR annotations. On such a small training corpus, we compare two systems. They use different learning techniques, but we find that this difference by itself only has a minor effect. A larger factor is that in English, a different GR length measure appears better suited for finding simple argument GRs than for finding modifier GRs. We also find that partitioning the data may help memory-based learning.",NLP,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0008004v1.pdf

Unfortunately, we find in a set of experiments that many commonly used tests often underestimate the significance and so are less likely to detect differences that exist between different techniques. This underestimation comes from an independence assumption that is often violated. We point out some useful tests that do not make this assumption, including computationally-intensive randomization tests.",NLP,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0008005v1.pdf

Second, we show how to accommodate a common property of manually constructed ``gold standards'' that are typically used for objective evaluation, namely that there is often more than one correct answer. Third, we show how to measure performance when the set of possible tags is tree-structured in an IS-A hierarchy.

The task we address in this paper consists of generating phonemic representations reflecting the Flemish and Dutch pronunciations of a word on the basis of its orthographic representation (which in turn is based on the actual speech recordings). We compare several possible approaches to achieve the text-to-pronunciation mapping task: memory-based learning, transformation-based learning, rule induction, maximum entropy modeling, combination of classifiers in stacked learning, and stacking of meta-learners. We are interested both in optimal accuracy and in obtaining insight into the linguistic regularities involved. As far as accuracy is concerned, an already high accuracy level (93% for Celex and 86% for Fonilex at word level) for single classifiers is boosted significantly with additional error reductions of 31% and 38% respectively using combination of classifiers, and a further 5% using combination of meta-learners, bringing overall word level accuracy to 96% for the Dutch variant and 92% for the Flemish variant. We also show that the application of machine learning methods indeed leads to increased insight into the linguistic regularities determining the variation between the two pronunciation variants studied.",NLP,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0008013v1.pdf

Parsing with the dop-model, however, seems to involve a lot of CPU cycles and a considerable amount of double work, brought on by the concept of multiple derivations, which is necessary for probabilistic processing, but which is not convincingly related to a proper linguistic backbone. It is however possible to re-interpret the dop-model as a pattern-matching model, which tries to maximize the size of the substructures that construct the parse, rather than the probability of the parse. By emphasizing this memory-based aspect of the dop-model, it is possible to do away with multiple derivations, opening up possibilities for efficient Viterbi-style optimizations, while still retaining acceptable parsing accuracy through enhanced context-sensitivity.",NLP,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0008014v1.pdf

After reviewing both the data and the basic tenets of One-level Prosodic Morphology, the analysis is laid out in some detail, using the notation of the FSA Utilities finite-state toolkit (van Noord 1997). One important discovery is that in this approach one can easily define a regular expression operator which ambiguously scans a string in the left- or rightward direction for a certain prosodic property.

We contrast two predictive parsing approaches, top-down and left-corner parsing, and find both to be viable.

Unfortunately the grammars produced by the standard left-corner transform are usually much larger than the original. The selective left-corner transform described in this paper produces a transformed grammar which simulates left-corner recognition of a user-specified set of the original productions, and top-down recognition of the others.

Despite their limitations, selectional restrictions have proven very useful in natural language applications, where they have been used frequently in word sense disambiguation, syntactic disambiguation, and anaphora resolution. Given their practical value, we explore two methods to incorporate selectional restrictions in the HPSG theory, assuming that the reader is familiar with HPSG. The first method employs HPSG's Background feature and a constraint-satisfaction component pipe-lined after the parser. The second method uses subsorts of referential indices, and blocks readings that violate selectional restrictions during parsing. While theoretically less satisfactory, we have found the second method particularly useful in the development of practical systems.",NLP,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0008023v1.pdf

Results using the parsed Wall Street Journal corpus show that in some circumstances, it is possible to obtain better estimation results using an informative sample than when training upon all the available material. Further experimentation demonstrates that with unlexicalised models, a Gaussian Prior can reduce overfitting. However, when models are lexicalised and contain overlapping features, overfitting does not seem to be a problem, and a Gaussian Prior makes minimal difference to performance. Our approach is applicable for situations when there are an infeasibly large number of parses in the training set, or else for when recovery of these parses from a packed representation is itself computationally expensive.",NLP,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0008024v1.pdf

Additionally, the entries that are generated potentially provide broader coverage of the category than would occur to an individual coding them by hand.

0008036v1,Probabilistic Constraint Logic Programming. Formal Foundations of   Quantitative and Statistical Inference in Constraint-Based Natural Language   Processing,Stefan Riezler,"In this thesis, we present two approaches to a rigorous mathematical and algorithmic foundation of quantitative and statistical inference in constraint-based natural language processing. The first approach, called quantitative constraint logic programming, is conceptualized in a clear logical framework, and presents a sound and complete system of quantitative inference for definite clauses annotated with subjective weights. This approach combines a rigorous formal semantics for quantitative inference based on subjective weights with efficient weight-based pruning for constraint-based systems. The second approach, called probabilistic constraint logic programming, introduces a log-linear probability distribution on the proof trees of a constraint logic program and an algorithm for statistical inference of the parameters and properties of such probability models from incomplete, i.e., unparsed data. The possibility of defining arbitrary properties of proof trees as properties of the log-linear probability model and efficiently estimating appropriate parameter values for them permits the probabilistic modeling of arbitrary context-dependencies in constraint logic programs. The usefulness of these ideas is evaluated empirically in a small-scale experiment on finding the correct parses of a constraint-based grammar. In addition, we address the problem of computational intractability of the calculation of expectations in the inference task and present various techniques to approximately solve this task. Moreover, we present an approximate heuristic technique for searching for the most probable analysis in probabilistic constraint logic programs.",NLP,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0008036v1.pdf

Multi-query optimization has hither-to been viewed as impractical, since earlier algorithms were exhaustive, and explore a doubly exponential search space.   In this paper we demonstrate that multi-query optimization using heuristics is practical, and provides significant benefits.

Query response times can be greatly improved by caching final/intermediate results of previous queries, and using them to answer later queries. In this paper we describe a caching system called Exchequer which incorporates several novel features including optimization aware cache maintenance and the use of a cache aware optimizer. In contrast, in existing work, the module that makes cost-benefit decisions is part of the cache manager and works independent of the optimizer which essentially reconsiders these decisions while finding the best plan for a query. In our work, the optimizer takes the decisions for the cache manager. Furthermore, existing approaches are either restricted to cube (slice/point) queries, or cache just the query results. On the other hand, our work is extens ible and in fact presents a data-model independent framework and algorithm. Our experimental results attest to the efficacy of our cache management techniques and show that over a wide range of parameters (a) Exchequer's query response times are lower by more than 30% compared to the best performing competitor, and (b) Exchequer can deliver the same response time as its competitor with just one tenth of the cache size.",DataMining,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0003005v1.pdf

Whenever the data warehouse is updated, the materialized views must also be updated. However, whereas the amount of data entering a warehouse, the query loads, and the need to obtain up-to-date responses are all increasing, the time window available for making the warehouse up-to-date is shrinking. These trends necessitate efficient techniques for the maintenance of materialized views.   In this paper, we show how to find an efficient plan for maintenance of a {\em set} of views, by exploiting common subexpressions between different view maintenance expressions. These common subexpressions may be materialized temporarily during view maintenance. Our algorithms also choose subexpressions/indices to be materialized permanently (and maintained along with other materialized views), to speed up view maintenance. While there has been much work on view maintenance in the past, our novel contributions lie in exploiting a recently developed framework for multiquery optimization to efficiently find good view maintenance plans as above. In addition to faster view maintenance, our algorithms can also be used to efficiently select materialized views to speed up workloads containing queries.",DataMining,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0003006v1.pdf

The modeling is based on techniques from the field of stochastic processes, and provides several stochastic models for content evolution in the base relations of a database, taking referential integrity constraints into account. These models are general enough to accommodate most of the common scenarios in databases, including batch insertions and life spans both with and without memory.

One of the main ideas to optimize the execution of an aggregate query is to reuse results of previously answered queries. This leads to the problem of rewriting aggregate queries using views. Due to a lack of theory, algorithms for this problem were rather ad-hoc. They were sound, but were not proven to be complete.   Recently we have given syntactic characterizations for the equivalence of aggregate queries and applied them to decide when there exist rewritings. However, these decision procedures do not lend themselves immediately to an implementation. In this paper, we present practical algorithms for rewriting queries with $\COUNT$ and $\SUM$. Our algorithms are sound. They are also complete for important cases. Our techniques can be used to improve well-known procedures for rewriting non-aggregate queries.

Thornton","The Harland document management system implements a data model in which document (object) structure can be altered by mixin-style multiple inheritance at any time. This kind of structural fluidity has long been supported by knowledge-base management systems, but its use has primarily been in support of reasoning and inference. In this paper, we report our experiences building and supporting several non-trivial applications on top of this data model. Based on these experiences, we argue that structural fluidity is convenient for data-intensive applications other than knowledge-base management. Specifically, we suggest that this flexible data model is a natural fit for the decoupled programming methodology that arises naturally when using enterprise component frameworks.",DataMining,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0103004v1.pdf
0106055v1,A Seamless Integration of Association Rule Mining with Database Systems,"Raj P. Gopalan, Tariq Nuruddin, Yudho Giri Sucahyo","The need for Knowledge and Data Discovery Management Systems (KDDMS) that support ad hoc data mining queries has been long recognized. A significant amount of research has gone into building tightly coupled systems that integrate association rule mining with database systems. In this paper, we describe a seamless integration scheme for database queries and association rule discovery using a common query optimizer for both. Query trees of expressions in an extended algebra are used for internal representation in the optimizer. The algebraic representation is flexible enough to deal with constrained association rule queries and other variations of association rule specifications. We propose modularization to simplify the query tree for complex tasks in data mining. It paves the way for making use of existing algorithms for constructing query plans in the optimization process. How the integration scheme we present will facilitate greater user control over the data mining process is also discussed. The work described in this paper forms part of a larger project for fully integrating data mining with database management.",DataMining,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0106055v1.pdf
0109084v1,The Internet and Community Networks: Case Studies of Five U.S. Cities,John B. Horrigan,"This paper looks at five U.S. cities (Austin, Cleveland, Nashville, Portland, and Washington, DC) and explores strategies being employed by community activists and local governments to create and sustain community networking projects. In some cities, community networking initiatives are relatively mature, while in others they are in early or intermediate stages. The paper looks at several factors that help explain the evolution of community networks in cities:   1) Local government support; 2) Federal support 3) Degree of community activism, often reflected by public-private partnerships that help support community networks.   In addition to these (more or less) measurable elements of local support, the case studies enable description of the different objectives of community networks in different cities. Several community networking projects aim to improve the delivery of government services (e.g., Portland and Cleveland), some have a job-training focus (e.g., Austin, Washington, DC), others are oriented very explicitly toward community building (Nashville, DC), and others toward neighborhood entrepreneurship (Portland and Cleveland).   The paper ties the case studies together by asking whether community technology initiatives contribute to social capital in the cities studied.",DataMining,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0109084v1.pdf
0110020v1,Structuring Business Metadata in Data Warehouse Systems for Effective   Business Support,N. L. Sarda,"Large organizations today are being served by different types of data processing and informations systems, ranging from the operational (OLTP) systems, data warehouse systems, to data mining and business intelligence applications. It is important to create an integrated repository of what these systems contain and do in order to use them collectively and effectively. The repository contains metadata of source systems, data warehouse, and also the business metadata. Decision support and business analysis require extensive and in-depth understanding of business entities, tasks, rules and the environment. The purpose of business metadata is to provide this understanding. Realizing the importance of metadata, many standardization efforts has been initiated to define metadata models. In trying to define an integrated metadata and information systems for a banking application, we discover some important limitations or inadequacies of the business metadata proposals. They relate to providing an integrated and flexible inter-operability and navigation between metadata and data, and to the important issue of systematically handling temporal characteristics and evolution of the metadata itself.   In this paper, we study the issue of structuring business metadata so that it can provide a context for business management and decision support when integrated with data warehousing. We define temporal object-oriented business metadata model, and relate it both to the technical metadata and the data warehouse. We also define ways of accessing and navigating metadata in conjunction with data.",DataMining,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0110020v1.pdf

0110052v1,Mragyati : A System for Keyword-based Searching in Databases,"N. L. Sarda, Ankur Jain","The web, through many search engine sites, has popularized the keyword-based search paradigm, where a user can specify a string of keywords and expect to retrieve relevant documents, possibly ranked by their relevance to the query. Since a lot of information is stored in databases (and not as HTML documents), it is important to provide a similar search paradigm for databases, where users can query a database without knowing the database schema and database query languages such as SQL. In this paper, we propose such a database search system, which accepts a free-form query as a collection of keywords, translates it into queries on the database using the database metadata, and presents query results in a well-structured and browsable form. Th eysytem maps keywords onto the database schema and uses inter-relationships (i.e., data semantics) among the referred tables to generate meaningful query results. We also describe our prototype for database search, called Mragyati. Th eapproach proposed here is scalable, as it does not build an in-memory graph of the entire database for searching for relationships among the objects selected by the user's query.",DataMining,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0110052v1.pdf

With the recent addition of the Java port, SDDS can now be deployed on virtually any operating system. Due to this proliferation, SDDS files serve to link not only a collection of C programs, but programs and scripts in many languages on different operating systems.

0202035v1,Sprinkling Selections over Join DAGs for Efficient Query Optimization,"Satyanarayana R Valluri, Soujanya Vadapalli, Kamalakar Karlapalem","In optimizing queries, solutions based on AND/OR DAG can generate all possible join orderings and select placements before searching for optimal query execution strategy. But as the number of joins and selection conditions increase, the space and time complexity to generate optimal query plan increases exponentially. In this paper, we use join graph for a relational database schema to either pre-compute all possible join orderings that can be executed and store it as a join DAG or, extract joins in the queries to incrementally build a history join DAG as and when the queries are executed. The select conditions in the queries are appropriately placed in the retrieved join DAG (or, history join DAG) to generate optimal query execution strategy. We experimentally evaluate our query optimization technique on TPC-D/H query sets to show their effectiveness over AND/OR DAG query optimization strategy. Finally, we illustrate how our technique can be used for efficient multiple query optimization and selection of materialized views in data warehousing environments.",DataMining,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0202035v1.pdf

In the context of such databases, a meta-query is a query about queries. Representing stored queries in XML, and using the standard XML manipulation language XSLT as a sublanguage, we show that just a few features need to be added to SQL to turn it into a fully-fledged meta-query language. The good news is that these features can be directly supported by extensible database technology.",DataMining,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0202037v2.pdf

We use the notion of consistent query answer -- a query answer which is true in every (minimal) repair of the database. We provide a complete classification of the computational complexity of consistent answers to first-order queries w.r.t. functional dependencies and denial constraints. We show how the complexity depends on the {\em type} of the constraints considered, their {\em number}, and the {\em size} of the query. We obtain several new PTIME cases, using new algorithms.",DataMining,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0204010v1.pdf
0205060v1,Optimizing Queries Using a Meta-level Database,Christoph Koch,"Graph simulation (using graph schemata or data guides) has been successfully proposed as a technique for adding structure to semistructured data. Design patterns for description (such as meta-classes and homomorphisms between schema layers), which are prominent in the object-oriented programming community, constitute a generalization of this graph simulation approach.   In this paper, we show description applicable to a wide range of data models that have some notion of object (-identity), and propose to turn it into a data model primitive much like, say, inheritance. We argue that such an extension fills a practical need in contemporary data management. Then, we present algebraic techniques for query optimization (using the notions of described and description queries). Finally, in the semistructured setting, we discuss the pruning of regular path queries (with nested conditions) using description meta-data. In this context, our notion of meta-data extends graph schemata and data guides by meta-level values, allowing to boost query performance and to reduce the redundancy of data.",DataMining,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0205060v1.pdf
0207093v1,Preference Queries,Jan Chomicki,"The handling of user preferences is becoming an increasingly important issue in present-day information systems. Among others, preferences are used for information filtering and extraction to reduce the volume of data presented to the user. They are also used to keep track of user profiles and formulate policies to improve and automate decision making.   We propose here a simple, logical framework for formulating preferences as preference formulas. The framework does not impose any restrictions on the preference relations and allows arbitrary operation and predicate signatures in preference formulas. It also makes the composition of preference relations straightforward. We propose a simple, natural embedding of preference formulas into relational algebra (and SQL) through a single winnow operator parameterized by a preference formula. The embedding makes possible the formulation of complex preference queries, e.g., involving aggregation, by piggybacking on existing SQL constructs. It also leads in a natural way to the definition of further, preference-related concepts like ranking. Finally, we present general algebraic laws governing the winnow operator and its interaction with other relational algebra operators. The preconditions on the applicability of the laws are captured by logical formulas. The laws provide a formal foundation for the algebraic optimization of preference queries. We demonstrate the usefulness of our approach through numerous examples.",DataMining,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0207093v1.pdf
0207094v1,Answer Sets for Consistent Query Answering in Inconsistent Databases,"Marcelo Arenas, Leopoldo Bertossi, Jan Chomicki","A relational database is inconsistent if it does not satisfy a given set of integrity constraints. Nevertheless, it is likely that most of the data in it is consistent with the constraints. In this paper we apply logic programming based on answer sets to the problem of retrieving consistent information from a possibly inconsistent database. Since consistent information persists from the original database to every of its minimal repairs, the approach is based on a specification of database repairs using disjunctive logic programs with exceptions, whose answer set semantics can be represented and computed by systems that implement stable model semantics. These programs allow us to declare persistence by defaults and repairing changes by exceptions. We concentrate mainly on logic programs for binary integrity constraints, among which we find most of the integrity constraints found in practice.",DataMining,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0207094v1.pdf
0211020v2,Monadic Datalog and the Expressive Power of Languages for Web   Information Extraction,"Georg Gottlob, Christoph Koch","Research on information extraction from Web pages (wrapping) has seen much activity recently (particularly systems implementations), but little work has been done on formally studying the expressiveness of the formalisms proposed or on the theoretical foundations of wrapping. In this paper, we first study monadic datalog over trees as a wrapping language. We show that this simple language is equivalent to monadic second order logic (MSO) in its ability to specify wrappers. We believe that MSO has the right expressiveness required for Web information extraction and propose MSO as a yardstick for evaluating and comparing wrappers. Along the way, several other results on the complexity of query evaluation and query containment for monadic datalog over trees are established, and a simple normal form for this language is presented. Using the above results, we subsequently study the kernel fragment Elog$^-$ of the Elog wrapping language used in the Lixto system (a visual wrapper generator). Curiously, Elog$^-$ exactly captures MSO, yet is easier to use. Indeed, programs in this language can be entirely visually specified.",DataMining,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0211020v2.pdf
0212004v1,Minimal-Change Integrity Maintenance Using Tuple Deletions,"Jan Chomicki, Jerzy Marcinkowski","We address the problem of minimal-change integrity maintenance in the context of integrity constraints in relational databases. We assume that integrity-restoration actions are limited to tuple deletions. We identify two basic computational issues: repair checking (is a database instance a repair of a given database?) and consistent query answers (is a tuple an answer to a given query in every repair of a given database?). We study the computational complexity of both problems, delineating the boundary between the tractable and the intractable. We consider denial constraints, general functional and inclusion dependencies, as well as key and foreign key constraints. Our results shed light on the computational feasibility of minimal-change integrity maintenance. The tractable cases should lead to practical implementations. The intractability results highlight the inherent limitations of any integrity enforcement mechanism, e.g., triggers or referential constraint actions, as a way of performing minimal-change integrity maintenance.",DataMining,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0212004v1.pdf

In this model spatio-temporal data is represented as a finite union of objects described by means of a spatial reference object, a temporal object and a geometric transformation function that determines the change or movement of the reference object in time.   We define a number of practically relevant classes of spatio-temporal objects, and give complete results concerning closure under Boolean set operators for these classes. Since only few classes are closed under all set operators, we suggest an extension of the model, which leads to better closure properties, and therefore increased practical applicability. We also discuss a normal form for this extended data model.",DataMining,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0212017v1.pdf

The semantic mechanisms currently available in service registries which are based on taxonomies fail to provide the means to achieve this. Although the terms taxonomy and ontology are sometimes used interchangably there is a critical difference. A taxonomy indicates only class/subclass relationship whereas an ontology describes a domain completely. The essential mechanisms that ontology languages provide include their formal specification (which allows them to be queried) and their ability to define properties of classes. Through properties very accurate descriptions of services can be defined and services can be related to other services or resources. In this paper, we discuss the advantages of describing service semantics through ontology languages and describe how to relate the semantics defined with the services advertised in service registries like UDDI and ebXML.",DataMining,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0212051v1.pdf

As a part of this framework, we extend the DAML-S upper ontology to describe the functionality we find essential for e-businesses. This functionality includes relating the services with electronic catalogs, describing the complementary services and finding services according to the properties of products or services. Once the semantics is defined, there is a need for a mechanism in the service registry to relate it with the service advertised. The ontology model developed is general enough to be used with any service registry. However when it comes to relating the semantics with services advertised, the capabilities provided by the registry effects how this is achieved. We demonstrate how to integrate the described service semantics to UDDI registries.",DataMining,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0212052v1.pdf

0301017v1,Completeness and Decidability Properties for Functional Dependencies in   XML,"Millist W. Vincent, Jixue Liu",XML is of great importance in information storage and retrieval because of its recent emergence as a standard for data representation and interchange on the Internet. However XML provides little semantic content and as a result several papers have addressed the topic of how to improve the semantic expressiveness of XML. Among the most important of these approaches has been that of defining integrity constraints in XML. In a companion paper we defined strong functional dependencies in XML(XFDs). We also presented a set of axioms for reasoning about the implication of XFDs and showed that the axiom system is sound for arbitrary XFDs. In this paper we prove that the axioms are also complete for unary XFDs (XFDs with a single path on the l.h.s.). The second contribution of the paper is to prove that the implication problem for unary XFDs is decidable and to provide a linear time algorithm for it.,DataMining,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0301017v1.pdf
0305038v1,The Evolution of the Computerized Database,Nancy Hartline Bercich,"Databases, collections of related data, are as old as the written word. A database can be anything from a homemaker's metal recipe file to a sophisticated data warehouse. Yet today, when we think of a database we invariably think of computerized data and their DBMSs (database management systems). How did we go from organizing our data in a simple metal filing box or cabinet to storing our data in a sophisticated computerized database? How did the computerized database evolve?   This paper defines what we mean by a database. It traces the evolution of the database, from its start as a non-computerized set of related data, to the, now standard, computerized RDBMS (relational database management system). Early computerized storage methods are reviewed including both the ISAM (Indexed Sequential Access Method) and VSAM (Virtual Storage Access Method) storage methods. Early database models are explored including the network and hierarchical database models. Eventually, the relational, object-relational and object-oriented databases models are discussed. An appendix of diagrams, including hierarchical occurrence tree, network schema, ER (entity relationship) and UML (unified modeling language) diagrams, is included to support the text.   This paper concludes with an exploration of current and future trends in DBMS development. It discusses the factors affecting these trends. It delves into the relationship between DBMSs and the increasingly popular object-oriented development methodologies. Finally, it speculates on the future of the DBMS.",DataMining,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0305038v1.pdf

Barros","Conditions Data in high energy physics experiments is frequently seen as every data needed for reconstruction besides the event data itself. This includes all sorts of slowly evolving data like detector alignment, calibration and robustness, and data from detector control system. Also, every Conditions Data Object is associated with a time interval of validity and a version. Besides that, quite often is useful to tag collections of Conditions Data Objects altogether. These issues have already been investigated and a data model has been proposed and used for different implementations based in commercial DBMSs, both at CERN and for the BaBar experiment. The special case of the ATLAS complex trigger that requires online access to calibration and alignment data poses new challenges that have to be met using a flexible and customizable solution more in the line of Open Source components. Motivated by the ATLAS challenges we have developed an alternative implementation, based in an Open Source RDBMS. Several issues were investigated land will be described in this paper:   -The best way to map the conditions data model into the relational database concept considering what are foreseen as the most frequent queries.   -The clustering model best suited to address the scalability problem. -Extensive tests were performed and will be described.

0306013v1,Transparent Persistence with Java Data Objects,Julius Hrivnac,"Flexible and performant Persistency Service is a necessary component of any HEP Software Framework. The building of a modular, non-intrusive and performant persistency component have been shown to be very difficult task. In the past, it was very often necessary to sacrifice modularity to achieve acceptable performance. This resulted in the strong dependency of the overall Frameworks on their Persistency subsystems.   Recent development in software technology has made possible to build a Persistency Service which can be transparently used from other Frameworks. Such Service doesn't force a strong architectural constraints on the overall Framework Architecture, while satisfying high performance requirements. Java Data Object standard (JDO) has been already implemented for almost all major databases. It provides truly transparent persistency for any Java object (both internal and external). Objects in other languages can be handled via transparent proxies. Being only a thin layer on top of a used database, JDO doesn't introduce any significant performance degradation. Also Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) makes possible to treat persistency as an orthogonal Aspect of the Application Framework, without polluting it with persistence-specific concepts.   All these techniques have been developed primarily (or only) for the Java environment. It is, however, possible to interface them transparently to Frameworks built in other languages, like for example C++.   Fully functional prototypes of flexible and non-intrusive persistency modules have been build for several other packages, as for example FreeHEP AIDA and LCG Pool AttributeSet (package Indicium).",DataMining,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0306013v1.pdf

The use of ROOT I/O for that purpose is quite unusual: the events are not read sequentially but pseudo-randomly, they are not processed one by one in memory but by bunches, and they do not contain orthodox ROOT objects but many foreign objects and templates. In this context, we have compared the performance of ROOT containers versus the STL vectors, and the use of trees versus a direct storage of containers. The strategy with best performances is by far the one using clones within trees, but it stays hard to tune and very dependant on the exact use-case. The use of STL vectors could bring more easily similar performances in a future ROOT release.",DataMining,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0306056v1.pdf

The Online BookKeeper (OBK) is a component of ATLAS online software that stores all information collected while running the experiment, including the Meta-data associated with the event acquisition, triggering and storage. The facilities for acquisition of control data within the on-line software framework, together with a full functional Web interface, make the OBK a powerful tool containing all information needed for event analysis, including an electronic log book.   In this paper we explain how OBK plays a role as one of the main collectors and managers of Meta-data produced on-line, and we'll also focus on the Web facilities already available. The usage of the web interface as an electronic run logbook is also explained, together with the future extensions.

Egilsson, Hakon Gudbjartsson","We introduce indexing of tables referencing complex structures such as digraphs and spatial objects, appearing in genetics and other data intensive analysis. The indexing is achieved by extracting dimension schemas from the referenced structures. The schemas and their dimensionality are determined by proper coloring algorithms and the duality between all such schemas and all such possible proper colorings is established. This duality, in turn, provides us with an extensive library of solutions when addressing indexing questions. It is illustrated how to use the schemas, in connection with additional relational database technologies, to optimize queries conditioned on the structural information being referenced. Comparisons using bitmap indexing in the Oracle 9.2i database, on the one hand, and multidimensional clustering in DB2 8.1.2, on the other hand, are used to illustrate the applicability of the indexing to different technology settings. Finally, we illustrate how the indexing can be used to extract low dimensional schemas from a binary interval tree in order to resolve efficiently interval and stabbing queries.",DataMining,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0309011v1.pdf

0310028v1,Providing Diversity in K-Nearest Neighbor Query Results,"Anoop Jain, Parag Sarda, Jayant R. Haritsa","Given a point query Q in multi-dimensional space, K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) queries return the K closest answers according to given distance metric in the database with respect to Q. In this scenario, it is possible that a majority of the answers may be very similar to some other, especially when the data has clusters. For a variety of applications, such homogeneous result sets may not add value to the user. In this paper, we consider the problem of providing diversity in the results of KNN queries, that is, to produce the closest result set such that each answer is sufficiently different from the rest. We first propose a user-tunable definition of diversity, and then present an algorithm, called MOTLEY, for producing a diverse result set as per this definition. Through a detailed experimental evaluation on real and synthetic data, we show that MOTLEY can produce diverse result sets by reading only a small fraction of the tuples in the database. Further, it imposes no additional overhead on the evaluation of traditional KNN queries, thereby providing a seamless interface between diversity and distance.",DataMining,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0310028v1.pdf
0310035v1,Supporting Exploratory Queries in Database Centric Web Applications,"Abhijit Kadlag, Amol Wanjari, Juliana Freire, Jayant R. Haritsa","Users of database-centric Web applications, especially in the e-commerce domain, often resort to exploratory ``trial-and-error'' queries since the underlying data space is huge and unfamiliar, and there are several alternatives for search attributes in this space. For example, scouting for cheap airfares typically involves posing multiple queries, varying flight times, dates, and airport locations. Exploratory queries are problematic from the perspective of both the user and the server. For the database server, it results in a drastic reduction in effective throughput since much of the processing is duplicated in each successive query. For the client, it results in a marked increase in response times, especially when accessing the service through wireless channels.   In this paper, we investigate the design of automated techniques to minimize the need for repetitive exploratory queries. Specifically, we present SAUNA, a server-side query relaxation algorithm that, given the user's initial range query and a desired cardinality for the answer set, produces a relaxed query that is expected to contain the required number of answers. The algorithm incorporates a range-query-specific distance metric that is weighted to produce relaxed queries of a desired shape (e.g. aspect ratio preserving), and utilizes multi-dimensional histograms for query size estimation. A detailed performance evaluation of SAUNA over a variety of multi-dimensional data sets indicates that its relaxed queries can significantly reduce the costs associated with exploratory query processing.",DataMining,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0310035v1.pdf

To encourage users to provide correct inputs, we recently proposed a data distortion scheme for association rule mining that simultaneously provides both privacy to the user and accuracy in the mining results. However, mining the distorted database can be orders of magnitude more time-consuming as compared to mining the original database. In this paper, we address this issue and demonstrate that by (a) generalizing the distortion process to perform symbol-specific distortion, (b) appropriately choosing the distortion parameters, and (c) applying a variety of optimizations in the reconstruction process, runtime efficiencies that are well within an order of magnitude of undistorted mining can be achieved.",DataMining,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0310038v1.pdf
0311038v1,XPath-Logic and XPathLog: A Logic-Programming Style XML Data   Manipulation Language,Wolfgang May,"We define XPathLog as a Datalog-style extension of XPath. XPathLog provides a clear, declarative language for querying and manipulating XML whose perspectives are especially in XML data integration. In our characterization, the formal semantics is defined wrt. an edge-labeled graph-based model which covers the XML data model. We give a complete, logic-based characterization of XML data and the main language concept for XML, XPath. XPath-Logic extends the XPath language with variable bindings and embeds it into first-order logic. XPathLog is then the Horn fragment of XPath-Logic, providing a Datalog-style, rule-based language for querying and manipulating XML data. The model-theoretic semantics of XPath-Logic serves as the base of XPathLog as a logic-programming language, whereas also an equivalent answer-set semantics for evaluating XPathLog queries is given. In contrast to other approaches, the XPath syntax and semantics is also used for a declarative specification how the database should be updated: when used in rule heads, XPath filters are interpreted as specifications of elements and properties which should be added to the database.",DataMining,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0311038v1.pdf

In particular we consider several (partial) stable model semantics, previously defined for deductive rules, such as well-founded, max deterministic, unique total stable model, total stable model, and maximal stable model semantics. The semantics of an active program AP is given by first rewriting it into a deductive program P, then computing a model M defining the declarative semantics of P and, finally, applying `consistent' updates contained in M to the source database. The framework we propose permits a natural integration of deductive and active rules and can also be applied to queries with function symbols or to queries over infinite databases.",DataMining,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0312042v1.pdf
0312043v1,On A Theory of Probabilistic Deductive Databases,"Laks V. S. Lakshmanan, Fereidoon Sadri","We propose a framework for modeling uncertainty where both belief and doubt can be given independent, first-class status. We adopt probability theory as the mathematical formalism for manipulating uncertainty. An agent can express the uncertainty in her knowledge about a piece of information in the form of a confidence level, consisting of a pair of intervals of probability, one for each of her belief and doubt. The space of confidence levels naturally leads to the notion of a trilattice, similar in spirit to Fitting's bilattices. Intuitively, thep oints in such a trilattice can be ordered according to truth, information, or precision. We develop a framework for probabilistic deductive databases by associating confidence levels with the facts and rules of a classical deductive database. While the trilattice structure offers a variety of choices for defining the semantics of probabilistic deductive databases, our choice of semantics is based on the truth-ordering, which we find to be closest to the classical framework for deductive databases. In addition to proposing a declarative semantics based on valuations and an equivalent semantics based on fixpoint theory, we also propose a proof procedure and prove it sound and complete. We show that while classical Datalog query programs have a polynomial time data complexity, certain query programs in the probabilistic deductive database framework do not even terminate on some input databases. We identify a large natural class of query programs of practical interest in our framework, and show that programs in this class possess polynomial time data complexity, i.e., not only do they terminate on every input database, they are guaranteed to do so in a number of steps polynomial in the input database size.",DataMining,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0312043v1.pdf

Preferences are primarily used to filter and personalize the information reaching the users of such systems. In database systems, preferences are usually captured as preference relations that are used to build preference queries. In our approach, preference queries are relational algebra or SQL queries that contain occurrences of the winnow operator (""find the most preferred tuples in a given relation"").   We present here a number of semantic optimization techniques applicable to preference queries. The techniques make use of integrity constraints, and make it possible to remove redundant occurrences of the winnow operator and to apply a more efficient algorithm for the computation of winnow. We also study the propagation of integrity constraints in the result of the winnow. We have identified necessary and sufficient conditions for the applicability of our techniques, and formulated those conditions as constraint satisfiability problems.",DataMining,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0402003v1.pdf

Szalay, Aniruddha R. Thakar","The Sloan Digital Sky Survey science database is approaching 2TB. While the vast majority of queries normally execute in seconds or minutes, this interactive execution time can be disproportionately increased by a small fraction of queries that take hours or days to run; either because they require non-index scans of the largest tables or because they request very large result sets. In response to this, we added a multi-queue job submission and tracking system. The transfer of very large result sets from queries over the network is another serious problem. Statistics suggested that much of this data transfer is unnecessary; users would prefer to store results locally in order to allow further cross matching and filtering. To allow local analysis, we implemented a system that gives users their own personal database (MyDB) at the portal site. Users may transfer data to their MyDB, and then perform further analysis before extracting it to their own machine.   We intend to extend the MyDB and asynchronous query ideas to multiple NVO nodes. This implies development, in a distributed manner, of several features, which have been demonstrated for a single node in the SDSS Batch Query System (CasJobs). The generalization of asynchronous queries necessitates some form of MyDB storage as well as workflow tracking services on each node and coordination strategies among nodes.",DataMining,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0403017v1.pdf

Scientists increasingly see their instruments through online scientific archives and analysis tools, rather than examining the raw data. Today this analysis is primarily driven by scientists asking queries, but scientific archives are becoming active databases that self-organize and recognize interesting and anomalous facts as data arrives. In some fields, data from many different archives can be cross-correlated to produce new insights.

Kunszt, Jim Gray","The Sloan Digital Sky Survey Science Archive is the first in a series of multi-Terabyte digital archives in Astronomy and other data-intensive sciences. To facilitate data mining in the SDSS archive, we adapted a commercial database engine and built specialized tools on top of it. Originally we chose an object-oriented database management system due to its data organization capabilities, platform independence, query performance and conceptual fit to the data. However, after using the object database for the first couple of years of the project, it soon began to fall short in terms of its query support and data mining performance. This was as much due to the inability of the database vendor to respond our demands for features and bug fixes as it was due to their failure to keep up with the rapid improvements in hardware performance, particularly faster RAID disk systems. In the end, we were forced to abandon the object database and migrate our data to a relational database. We describe below the technical issues that we faced with the object database and how and why we migrated to relational technology.",DataMining,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0403020v1.pdf
0404003v1,Enhancing the expressive power of the U-Datalog language,"Elisa Bertino, Barbara Catania, Roberta Gori","U-Datalog has been developed with the aim of providing a set-oriented logical update language, guaranteeing update parallelism in the context of a Datalog-like language. In U-Datalog, updates are expressed by introducing constraints (+p(X), to denote insertion, and [minus sign]p(X), to denote deletion) inside Datalog rules. A U-Datalog program can be interpreted as a CLP program. In this framework, a set of updates (constraints) is satisfiable if it does not represent an inconsistent theory, that is, it does not require the insertion and the deletion of the same fact. This approach resembles a very simple form of negation. However, on the other hand, U-Datalog does not provide any mechanism to explicitly deal with negative information, resulting in a language with limited expressive power. In this paper, we provide a semantics, based on stratification, handling the use of negated atoms in U-Datalog programs, and we show which problems arise in defining a compositional semantics.",DataMining,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0404003v1.pdf

Then, extended abduction, which was introduced by the same authors as a generalization of traditional abduction, is computed by the answer sets of update programs. Next, different types of updates, view updates and theory updates are characterized by abductive programs and computed by update programs. The task of consistency restoration is also realized as special cases of these updates. Each update problem is comparatively assessed from the computational complexity viewpoint. The result of this paper provides a uniform framework for different types of knowledge base updates, and each update is computed using existing procedures of logic programming.",DataMining,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0405076v1.pdf

0408030v1,The Revolution In Database System Architecture,Jim Gray,"Database system architectures are undergoing revolutionary changes. Algorithms and data are being unified by integrating programming languages with the database system. This gives an extensible object-relational system where non-procedural relational operators manipulate object sets. Coupled with this, each DBMS is now a web service. This has huge implications for how we structure applications. DBMSs are now object containers. Queues are the first objects to be added. These queues are the basis for transaction processing and workflow applica-tions. Future workflow systems are likely to be built on this core. Data cubes and online analytic processing are now baked into most DBMSs. Beyond that, DBMSs have a framework for data mining and machine learning algorithms. Decision trees, Bayes nets, clustering, and time series analysis are built in; new algorithms can be added. Text, temporal, and spatial data access methods, along with their probabilistic reasoning have been added to database systems. Allowing approximate and probabilistic answers is essential for many applications. Many believe that XML and xQuery will be the main data structure and access pattern. Database systems must accommodate that perspective.These changes mandate a much more dynamic query optimization strategy. Intelligence is moving to the periphery of the network. Each disk and each sensor will be a competent database machine. Relational algebra is a convenient way to program these systems. Database systems are now expected to be self-managing, self-healing, and always-up.",DataMining,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0408030v1.pdf

Rots","We explored ways of doing spatial search within a relational database: (1) hierarchical triangular mesh (a tessellation of the sphere), (2) a zoned bucketing system, and (3) representing areas as disjunctive-normal form constraints. Each of these approaches has merits. They all allow efficient point-in-region queries. A relational representation for regions allows Boolean operations among them and allows quick tests for point-in-region, regions-containing-point, and region-overlap. The speed of these algorithms is much improved by a zone and multi-scale zone-pyramid scheme. The approach has the virtue that the zone mechanism works well on B-Trees native to all SQL systems and integrates naturally with current query optimizers - rather than requiring a new spatial access method and concomitant query optimizer extensions.

It is widely supported by application platform software. However, little optimization effort has been made inside the current XSLT processing engines. Evaluating a very simple XSLT program on a large XML document with a simple schema may result in extensive usage of memory. In this paper, we present a novel notion of \emph{Streaming Processing Model} (\emph{SPM}) to evaluate a subset of XSLT programs on XML documents, especially large ones. With SPM, an XSLT processor can transform an XML source document to other formats without extra memory buffers required. Therefore, our approach can not only tackle large source documents, but also produce large results. We demonstrate with a performance study the advantages of the SPM approach. Experimental results clearly confirm that SPM improves XSLT evaluation typically 2 to 10 times better than the existing approaches. Moreover, the SPM approach also features high scalability.",DataMining,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0408051v1.pdf

There are situations where the closed world assumption to infer negative facts is not valid or undesirable and there is a need to represent and reason with negation explicitly. We consider explicit disjunctive negation in the context of disjunctive databases as there is an interesting interplay between these two types of information.

Our data model is capable of manipulating incomplete as well as inconsistent information. Fuzzy relation or intuitionistic fuzzy relation can only handle incomplete information. Associated with each relation are two membership functions one is called truth-membership function $T$ which keeps track of the extent to which we believe the tuple is in the relation, another is called false-membership function which keeps track of the extent to which we believe that it is not in the relation. A paraconsistent intuitionistic fuzzy relation is inconsistent if there exists one tuple $a$ such that $T(a) + F(a) > 1$. In order to handle inconsistent situation, we propose an operator called split to transform inconsistent paraconsistent intuitionistic fuzzy relations into pseudo-consistent paraconsistent intuitionistic fuzzy relations and do the set-theoretic and relation-theoretic operations on them and finally use another operator called combine to transform the result back to paraconsistent intuitionistic fuzzy relation. For this model, we define algebraic operators that are generalisations of the usual operators such as union, selection, join on fuzzy relations.

This problem can be formalized as follows. Suppose that a transformation T producing a summary from a multidimensional data set is used. Now, given a data set D, a summary S=T(D) and a range query r on D, the problem consists of studying r by modelling it as a random variable defined over the sample space of all the data sets D' such that T(D) = S. The study of such a random variable, done by the definition of its probability distribution and the computation of its mean value and variance, represents a well-founded, theoretical probabilistic approach for estimating the query only on the basis of the available information (that is the summary S) without assumptions on original data.",DataMining,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0501029v1.pdf

0503012v2,First-order Complete and Computationally Complete Query Languages for   Spatio-Temporal Databases,"Floris Geerts, Sofie Haesevoets, Bart Kuijpers","We address a fundamental question concerning spatio-temporal database systems: ``What are exactly spatio-temporal queries?'' We define spatio-temporal queries to be computable mappings that are also generic, meaning that the result of a query may only depend to a limited extent on the actual internal representation of the spatio-temporal data. Genericity is defined as invariance under groups of geometric transformations that preserve certain characteristics of spatio-temporal data (e.g., collinearity, distance, velocity, acceleration, ...). These groups depend on the notions that are relevant in particular spatio-temporal database applications.   These transformations also have the distinctive property that they respect the monotone and unidirectional nature of time.   We investigate different genericity classes with respect to the constraint database model for spatio-temporal databases and we identify sound and complete languages for the first-order and the computable queries in these genericity classes. We distinguish between genericity determined by time-invariant transformations, genericity notions concerning physical quantities and genericity determined by time-dependent transformations.",DataMining,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0503012v2.pdf
0503022v2,Theory and Practice of Transactional Method Caching,"Daniel Pfeifer, Peter C. Lockemann","Nowadays, tiered architectures are widely accepted for constructing large scale information systems. In this context application servers often form the bottleneck for a system's efficiency. An application server exposes an object oriented interface consisting of set of methods which are accessed by potentially remote clients. The idea of method caching is to store results of read-only method invocations with respect to the application server's interface on the client side. If the client invokes the same method with the same arguments again, the corresponding result can be taken from the cache without contacting the server. It has been shown that this approach can considerably improve a real world system's efficiency.   This paper extends the concept of method caching by addressing the case where clients wrap related method invocations in ACID transactions. Demarcating sequences of method calls in this way is supported by many important application server standards. In this context the paper presents an architecture, a theory and an efficient protocol for maintaining full transactional consistency and in particular serializability when using a method cache on the client side. In order to create a protocol for scheduling cached method results, the paper extends a classical transaction formalism. Based on this extension, a recovery protocol and an optimistic serializability protocol are derived. The latter one differs from traditional transactional cache protocols in many essential ways. An efficiency experiment validates the approach: Using the cache a system's performance and scalability are considerably improved.",DataMining,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0503022v2.pdf
0505038v1,Efficient Management of Short-Lived Data,"Albrecht Schmidt, Christian S. Jensen","Motivated by the increasing prominence of loosely-coupled systems, such as mobile and sensor networks, which are characterised by intermittent connectivity and volatile data, we study the tagging of data with so-called expiration times. More specifically, when data are inserted into a database, they may be tagged with time values indicating when they expire, i.e., when they are regarded as stale or invalid and thus are no longer considered part of the database. In a number of applications, expiration times are known and can be assigned at insertion time. We present data structures and algorithms for online management of data tagged with expiration times. The algorithms are based on fully functional, persistent treaps, which are a combination of binary search trees with respect to a primary attribute and heaps with respect to a secondary attribute. The primary attribute implements primary keys, and the secondary attribute stores expiration times in a minimum heap, thus keeping a priority queue of tuples to expire. A detailed and comprehensive experimental study demonstrates the well-behavedness and scalability of the approach as well as its efficiency with respect to a number of competitors.",DataMining,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0505038v1.pdf

Such mechanisms need to take full advantage of the hierarchical structure of semistructured data, for instance allowing concurrent updates of subtrees of, or even individual elements in, XML documents. We present an approach for concurrency control which is document-independent in the sense that two schedules of semistructured transactions are considered equivalent if they are equivalent on all possible documents. We prove that it is decidable in polynomial time whether two given schedules in this framework are equivalent. This also solves the view serializability for semistructured schedules polynomially in the size of the schedule and exponentially in the number of transactions.",DataMining,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0505074v1.pdf

Lakshmanan","We study a collection of heterogeneous XML databases maintaining similar and related information, exchanging data via a peer to peer overlay network. In this setting, a mediated global schema is unrealistic. Yet, users/applications wish to query the databases via one peer using its schema. We have recently developed HepToX, a P2P Heterogeneous XML database system. A key idea is that whenever a peer enters the system, it establishes an acquaintance with a small number of peer databases, possibly with different schema. The peer administrator provides correspondences between the local schema and the acquaintance schema using an informal and intuitive notation of arrows and boxes. We develop a novel algorithm that infers a set of precise mapping rules between the schemas from these visual annotations. We pin down a semantics of query translation given such mapping rules, and present a novel query translation algorithm for a simple but expressive fragment of XQuery, that employs the mapping rules in either direction. We show the translation algorithm is correct. Finally, we demonstrate the utility and scalability of our ideas and algorithms with a detailed set of experiments on top of the Emulab, a large scale P2P network emulation testbed.",DataMining,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0506002v1.pdf

Genesereth","In this paper we study the problem of reducing the evaluation costs of queries on finite databases in presence of integrity constraints, by designing and materializing views. Given a database schema, a set of queries defined on the schema, a set of integrity constraints, and a storage limit, to find a solution to this problem means to find a set of views that satisfies the storage limit, provides equivalent rewritings of the queries under the constraints (this requirement is weaker than equivalence in the absence of constraints), and reduces the total costs of evaluating the queries. This problem, database reformulation, is important for many applications, including data warehousing and query optimization. We give complexity results and algorithms for database reformulation in presence of constraints, for conjunctive queries, views, and rewritings and for several types of constraints, including functional and inclusion dependencies. To obtain better complexity results, we introduce an unchase technique, which reduces the problem of query equivalence under constraints to equivalence in the absence of constraints without increasing query size.",DataMining,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0506026v1.pdf

The search for FPs is carried out by using an iterative sieve algorithm by computing the set of enclosed cycles. In each inner cycle of level FPs composed of elements are generated. The assigned number of enclosed cycles (the parameter of the problem) defines the maximum length of the desired FPs.

0604076v1,Semantically Correct Query Answers in the Presence of Null Values,"Loreto Bravo, Leopoldo Bertossi","For several reasons a database may not satisfy a given set of integrity constraints(ICs), but most likely most of the information in it is still consistent with those ICs; and could be retrieved when queries are answered. Consistent answers to queries wrt a set of ICs have been characterized as answers that can be obtained from every possible minimally repaired consistent version of the original database. In this paper we consider databases that contain null values and are also repaired, if necessary, using null values. For this purpose, we propose first a precise semantics for IC satisfaction in a database with null values that is compatible with the way null values are treated in commercial database management systems. Next, a precise notion of repair is introduced that privileges the introduction of null values when repairing foreign key constraints, in such a way that these new values do not create an infinite cycle of new inconsistencies. Finally, we analyze how to specify this kind of repairs of a database that contains null values using disjunctive logic programs with stable model semantics.",DataMining,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0604076v1.pdf

Either they are not strong enough for representing results of simple queries, or the handling and processing of the data, e.g. for query evaluation, is intractable.   In this paper, we present a decomposition-based approach to addressing this problem. We introduce world-set decompositions (WSDs), a space-efficient formalism for representing any finite set of possible worlds over relational databases. WSDs are therefore a strong representation system for any relational query language. We study the problem of efficiently evaluating relational algebra queries on sets of worlds represented by WSDs.

0611031v2,Efficient Threshold Aggregation of Moving Objects,"Scot Anderson, Peter Revesz","Calculating aggregation operators of moving point objects, using time as a continuous variable, presents unique problems when querying for congestion in a moving and changing (or dynamic) query space. We present a set of congestion query operators, based on a threshold value, that estimate the following 5 aggregation operations in d-dimensions. 1) We call the count of point objects that intersect the dynamic query space during the query time interval, the CountRange. 2) We call the Maximum (or Minimum) congestion in the dynamic query space at any time during the query time interval, the MaxCount (or MinCount). 3) We call the sum of time that the dynamic query space is congested, the ThresholdSum. 4) We call the number of times that the dynamic query space is congested, the ThresholdCount. And 5) we call the average length of time of all the time intervals when the dynamic query space is congested, the ThresholdAverage. These operators rely on a novel approach to transforming the problem of selection based on position to a problem of selection based on a threshold. These operators can be used to predict concentrations of migrating birds that may carry disease such as Bird Flu and hence the information may be used to predict high risk areas. On a smaller scale, those operators are also applicable to maintaining safety in airplane operations. We present the theory of our estimation operators and provide algorithms for exact operators. The implementations of those operators, and experiments, which include data from more than 7500 queries, indicate that our estimation operators produce fast, efficient results with error under 5%.",DataMining,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0611031v2.pdf

Sobhan Babu","Algorithms that exploit sort orders are widely used to implement joins, grouping, duplicate elimination and other set operations. Query optimizers traditionally deal with sort orders by using the notion of interesting orders. The number of interesting orders is unfortunately factorial in the number of participating attributes. Optimizer implementations use heuristics to prune the number of interesting orders, but the quality of the heuristics is unclear. Increasingly complex decision support queries and increasing use of covering indices, which provide multiple alternative sort orders for relations, motivate us to better address the problem of optimization with interesting orders.   We show that even a simplified version of optimization with sort orders is NP-hard and provide principled heuristics for choosing interesting orders. We have implemented the proposed techniques in a Volcano-style cost-based optimizer, and our performance study shows significant improvements in estimated cost. We also executed our plans on a widely used commercial database system, and on PostgreSQL, and found that actual execution times for our plans were significantly better than for plans generated by those systems in several cases.",DataMining,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0611094v1.pdf

These are conflicting goals. We use a definition of privacy that is derived from existing ones in the literature, which relates the a priori probability of a given tuple t, Pr(t), with the a posteriori probability, Pr(t | V), and propose a novel and quite practical definition for utility. Our main result is the following. Denoting n the size of I and m the size of the domain from which I was drawn (i.e. n < m) then: when the a priori probability is Pr(t) = Omega(n/sqrt(m)) for some t, there exists no useful anonymization algorithm, while when Pr(t) = O(n/m) for all tuples t, then we give a concrete anonymization algorithm that is both private and useful.

0612111v1,Fragmentation in Large Object Repositories,"Russell Sears, Catharine van Ingen","Fragmentation leads to unpredictable and degraded application performance. While these problems have been studied in detail for desktop filesystem workloads, this study examines newer systems such as scalable object stores and multimedia repositories. Such systems use a get/put interface to store objects. In principle, databases and filesystems can support such applications efficiently, allowing system designers to focus on complexity, deployment cost and manageability. Although theoretical work proves that certain storage policies behave optimally for some workloads, these policies often behave poorly in practice. Most storage benchmarks focus on short-term behavior or do not measure fragmentation. We compare SQL Server to NTFS and find that fragmentation dominates performance when object sizes exceed 256KB-1MB. NTFS handles fragmentation better than SQL Server. Although the performance curves will vary with other systems and workloads, we expect the same interactions between fragmentation and free space to apply. It is well-known that fragmentation is related to the percentage free space. We found that the ratio of free space to object size also impacts performance. Surprisingly, in both systems, storing objects of a single size causes fragmentation, and changing the size of write requests affects fragmentation. These problems could be addressed with simple changes to the filesystem and database interfaces. It is our hope that an improved understanding of fragmentation will lead to predictable storage systems that require less maintenance after deployment.",DataMining,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0612111v1.pdf

Traditionally, cluster management systems such as Condor employ a process-oriented approach with little or no use of modern database system technology. In contrast, CondorJ2 employs a data-centric, 3-tier web-application architecture for all system functions (e.g., job submission, monitoring and scheduling; node configuration, monitoring and management, etc.) except for job execution. Employing a data-oriented approach allows the core challenge (i.e., managing and coordinating a large set of distributed computing resources) to be transformed from a relatively low-level systems problem into a more abstract, higher-level data management problem. Preliminary results suggest that CondorJ2's use of standard 3-tier software represents a significant step forward to the design and implementation of large clusters (1,000 to 10,000 nodes).",DataMining,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0612137v1.pdf

The SQL aggregate functions and the GROUP BY operator produce zero-dimensional or one-dimensional aggregates. Applications need the N-dimensional generalization of these operators. This paper defines that operator, called the data cube or simply cube. The cube operator generalizes the histogram, cross-tabulation, roll-up, drill-down, and sub-total constructs found in most report writers. The novelty is that cubes are relations. Consequently, the cube operator can be imbedded in more complex non-procedural data analysis programs. The cube operator treats each of the N aggregation attributes as a dimension of N-space. The aggregate of a particular set of attribute values is a point in this space. The set of points forms an N-dimensional cube. Super-aggregates are computed by aggregating the N-cube to lower dimensional spaces.

0701156v1,"Data Management: Past, Present, and Future",Jim Gray,"Soon most information will be available at your fingertips, anytime, anywhere. Rapid advances in storage, communications, and processing allow us move all information into Cyberspace. Software to define, search, and visualize online information is also a key to creating and accessing online information. This article traces the evolution of data management systems and outlines current trends. Data management systems began by automating traditional tasks: recording transactions in business, science, and commerce. This data consisted primarily of numbers and character strings. Today these systems provide the infrastructure for much of our society, allowing fast, reliable, secure, and automatic access to data distributed throughout the world. Increasingly these systems automatically design and manage access to the data. The next steps are to automate access to richer forms of data: images, sound, video, maps, and other media. A second major challenge is automatically summarizing and abstracting data in anticipation of user requests. These multi-media databases and tools to access them will be a cornerstone of our move to Cyberspace.",DataMining,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0701156v1.pdf
0701157v1,A Critique of ANSI SQL Isolation Levels,"Hal Berenson, Phil Bernstein, Jim Gray, Jim Melton, Elizabeth O'Neil, Patrick O'Neil","ANSI SQL-92 defines Isolation Levels in terms of phenomena: Dirty Reads, Non-Repeatable Reads, and Phantoms. This paper shows that these phenomena and the ANSI SQL definitions fail to characterize several popular isolation levels, including the standard locking implementations of the levels. Investigating the ambiguities of the phenomena leads to clearer definitions; in addition new phenomena that better characterize isolation types are introduced. An important multiversion isolation type, Snapshot Isolation, is defined.",DataMining,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0701157v1.pdf
0701158v1,Queues Are Databases,Jim Gray,"Message-oriented-middleware (MOM) has become an small industry. MOM offers queued transaction processing as an advance over pure client-server transaction processing. This note makes four points: Queued transaction processing is less general than direct transaction processing. Queued systems are built on top of direct systems. You cannot build a direct system atop a queued system. It is difficult to build direct, conversational, or distributed transactions atop a queued system. Queues are interesting databases with interesting concurrency control. It is best to build these mechanisms into a standard database system so other applications can use these interesting features. Queue systems need DBMS functionality. Queues need security, configuration, performance monitoring, recovery, and reorganization utilities. Database systems already have these features. A full-function MOM system duplicates these database features. Queue managers are simple TP-monitors managing server pools driven by queues. Database systems are encompassing many server pool features as they evolve to TP-lite systems.",DataMining,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0701158v1.pdf
0701168v1,To BLOB or Not To BLOB: Large Object Storage in a Database or a   Filesystem?,"Russell Sears, Catharine Van Ingen, Jim Gray","Application designers often face the question of whether to store large objects in a filesystem or in a database. Often this decision is made for application design simplicity. Sometimes, performance measurements are also used. This paper looks at the question of fragmentation - one of the operational issues that can affect the performance and/or manageability of the system as deployed long term. As expected from the common wisdom, objects smaller than 256KB are best stored in a database while objects larger than 1M are best stored in the filesystem. Between 256KB and 1MB, the read:write ratio and rate of object overwrite or replacement are important factors. We used the notion of ""storage age"" or number of object overwrites as way of normalizing wall clock time. Storage age allows our results or similar such results to be applied across a number of read:write ratios and object replacement rates.",DataMining,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0701168v1.pdf
0702075v1,Firebird Database Backup by Serialized Database Table Dump,Maurice HT Ling,"This paper presents a simple data dump and load utility for Firebird databases which mimics mysqldump in MySQL. This utility, fb_dump and fb_load, for dumping and loading respectively, retrieves each database table using kinterbasdb and serializes the data using marshal module. This utility has two advantages over the standard Firebird database backup utility, gbak. Firstly, it is able to backup and restore single database tables which might help to recover corrupted databases. Secondly, the output is in text-coded format (from marshal module) making it more resilient than a compressed text backup, as in the case of using gbak.",DataMining,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0702075v1.pdf
0702143v1,Attribute Value Reordering For Efficient Hybrid OLAP,"Owen Kaser, Daniel Lemire","The normalization of a data cube is the ordering of the attribute values. For large multidimensional arrays where dense and sparse chunks are stored differently, proper normalization can lead to improved storage efficiency. We show that it is NP-hard to compute an optimal normalization even for 1x3 chunks, although we find an exact algorithm for 1x2 chunks. When dimensions are nearly statistically independent, we show that dimension-wise attribute frequency sorting is an optimal normalization and takes time O(d n log(n)) for data cubes of size n^d. When dimensions are not independent, we propose and evaluate several heuristics. The hybrid OLAP (HOLAP) storage mechanism is already 19%-30% more efficient than ROLAP, but normalization can improve it further by 9%-13% for a total gain of 29%-44% over ROLAP.",DataMining,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0702143v1.pdf
0703113v1,Automatic Selection of Bitmap Join Indexes in Data Warehouses,"Kamel Aouiche, Jerome Darmont, Omar Boussaid, Fadila Bentayeb","The queries defined on data warehouses are complex and use several join operations that induce an expensive computational cost. This cost becomes even more prohibitive when queries access very large volumes of data. To improve response time, data warehouse administrators generally use indexing techniques such as star join indexes or bitmap join indexes. This task is nevertheless complex and fastidious. Our solution lies in the field of data warehouse auto-administration. In this framework, we propose an automatic index selection strategy. We exploit a data mining technique ; more precisely frequent itemset mining, in order to determine a set of candidate indexes from a given workload. Then, we propose several cost models allowing to create an index configuration composed by the indexes providing the best profit. These models evaluate the cost of accessing data using bitmap join indexes, and the cost of updating and storing these indexes.",DataMining,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0703113v1.pdf
0703114v1,Clustering-Based Materialized View Selection in Data Warehouses,"Kamel Aouiche, Pierre-Emmanuel Jouve, Jerome Darmont","Materialized view selection is a non-trivial task. Hence, its complexity must be reduced. A judicious choice of views must be cost-driven and influenced by the workload experienced by the system. In this paper, we propose a framework for materialized view selection that exploits a data mining technique (clustering), in order to determine clusters of similar queries. We also propose a view merging algorithm that builds a set of candidate views, as well as a greedy process for selecting a set of views to materialize. This selection is based on cost models that evaluate the cost of accessing data using views and the cost of storing these views. To validate our strategy, we executed a workload of decision-support queries on a test data warehouse, with and without using our strategy. Our experimental results demonstrate its efficiency, even when storage space is limited.",DataMining,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0703114v1.pdf
0704.3500v1,Une plate-forme dynamique pour l'évaluation des performances des bases   de données à objets,"Zhen He, Jérôme Darmont","In object-oriented or object-relational databases such as multimedia databases or most XML databases, access patterns are not static, i.e., applications do not always access the same objects in the same order repeatedly. However, this has been the way these databases and associated optimisation techniques such as clustering have been evaluated up to now. This paper opens up research regarding this issue by proposing a dynamic object evaluation framework (DOEF). DOEF accomplishes access pattern change by defining configurable styles of change. It is a preliminary prototype that has been designed to be open and fully extensible. Though originally designed for the object-oriented model, it can also be used within the object-relational model with few adaptations. Furthermore, new access pattern change models can be added too. To illustrate the capabilities of DOEF, we conducted two different sets of experiments. In the first set of experiments, we used DOEF to compare the performances of four state of the art dynamic clustering algorithms. The results show that DOEF is effective at determining the adaptability of each dynamic clustering algorithm to changes in access pattern. They also led us to conclude that dynamic clustering algorithms can cope with moderate levels of access pattern change, but that performance rapidly degrades to be worse than no clustering when vigorous styles of access pattern change are applied. In the second set of experiments, we used DOEF to compare the performance of two different object stores: Platypus and SHORE. The use of DOEF exposed the poor swapping performance of Platypus.",DataMining,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.3500v1.pdf
0704.3501v1,Conception d'un banc d'essais décisionnel,"Jérôme Darmont, Fadila Bentayeb, Omar Boussaïd","We present in this paper a new benchmark for evaluating the performances of data warehouses. Benchmarking is useful either to system users for comparing the performances of different systems, or to system engineers for testing the effect of various design choices. While the TPC (Transaction Processing Performance Council) standard benchmarks address the first point, they are not tuneable enough to address the second one. Our Data Warehouse Engineering Benchmark (DWEB) allows to generate various ad-hoc synthetic data warehouses and workloads. DWEB is fully parameterized. However, two levels of parameterization keep it easy to tune. Since DWEB mainly meets engineering benchmarking needs, it is complimentary to the TPC standard benchmarks, and not a competitor. Finally, DWEB is implemented as a Java free software that can be interfaced with most existing relational database management systems.",DataMining,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.3501v1.pdf
0704.3520v1,Vers l'auto-administration des entrepôts de données,"Kamel Aouiche, Jérôme Darmont","With the wide development of databases in general and data warehouses in particular, it is important to reduce the tasks that a database administrator must perform manually. The idea of using data mining techniques to extract useful knowledge for administration from the data themselves has existed for some years. However, little research has been achieved. The aim of this study is to search for a way of extracting useful knowledge from stored data to automatically apply performance optimization techniques, and more particularly indexing techniques. We have designed a tool that extracts frequent itemsets from a given workload to compute an index configuration that helps optimizing data access time. The experiments we performed showed that the index configurations generated by our tool allowed performance gains of 15% to 25% on a test database and a test data warehouse.",DataMining,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.3520v1.pdf
0705.0281v1,Dynamic Clustering in Object-Oriented Databases: An Advocacy for   Simplicity,"Jérôme Darmont, Christophe Fromantin, Stéphane Régnier, Le Gruenwald, Michel Schneider","We present in this paper three dynamic clustering techniques for Object-Oriented Databases (OODBs). The first two, Dynamic, Statistical & Tunable Clustering (DSTC) and StatClust, exploit both comprehensive usage statistics and the inter-object reference graph. They are quite elaborate. However, they are also complex to implement and induce a high overhead. The third clustering technique, called Detection & Reclustering of Objects (DRO), is based on the same principles, but is much simpler to implement. These three clustering algorithm have been implemented in the Texas persistent object store and compared in terms of clustering efficiency (i.e., overall performance increase) and overhead using the Object Clustering Benchmark (OCB). The results obtained showed that DRO induced a lighter overhead while still achieving better overall performance.",DataMining,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0705.0281v1.pdf
0705.0450v1,VOODB: A Generic Discrete-Event Random Simulation Model to Evaluate the   Performances of OODBs,"Jérôme Darmont, Michel Schneider","Performance of object-oriented database systems (OODBs) is still an issue to both designers and users nowadays. The aim of this paper is to propose a generic discrete-event random simulation model, called VOODB, in order to evaluate the performances of OODBs in general, and the performances of optimization methods like clustering in particular. Such optimization methods undoubtedly improve the performances of OODBs. Yet, they also always induce some kind of overhead for the system. Therefore, it is important to evaluate their exact impact on the overall performances. VOODB has been designed as a generic discrete-event random simulation model by putting to use a modelling approach, and has been validated by simulating the behavior of the O2 OODB and the Texas persistent object store. Since our final objective is to compare object clustering algorithms, some experiments have also been conducted on the DSTC clustering technique, which is implemented in Texas. To validate VOODB, performance results obtained by simulation for a given experiment have been compared to the results obtained by benchmarking the real systems in the same conditions. Benchmarking and simulation performance evaluations have been observed to be consistent, so it appears that simulation can be a reliable approach to evaluate the performances of OODBs.",DataMining,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0705.0450v1.pdf
0705.0453v1,OCB: A Generic Benchmark to Evaluate the Performances of Object-Oriented   Database Systems,"Jérôme Darmont, Bertrand Petit, Michel Schneider","We present in this paper a generic object-oriented benchmark (the Object Clustering Benchmark) that has been designed to evaluate the performances of clustering policies in object-oriented databases. OCB is generic because its sample database may be customized to fit the databases introduced by the main existing benchmarks (e.g., OO1). OCB's current form is clustering-oriented because of its clustering-oriented workload, but it can be easily adapted to other purposes. Lastly, OCB's code is compact and easily portable. OCB has been implemented in a real system (Texas, running on a Sun workstation), in order to test a specific clustering policy called DSTC. A few results concerning this test are presented.",DataMining,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0705.0453v1.pdf
0705.0454v1,Performance Evaluation for Clustering Algorithms in Object-Oriented   Database Systems,"Jérôme Darmont, Amar Attoui, Michel Gourgand","It is widely acknowledged that good object clustering is critical to the performance of object-oriented databases. However, object clustering always involves some kind of overhead for the system. The aim of this paper is to propose a modelling methodology in order to evaluate the performances of different clustering policies. This methodology has been used to compare the performances of three clustering algorithms found in the literature (Cactis, CK and ORION) that we considered representative of the current research in the field of object clustering. The actual performance evaluation was performed using simulation. Simulation experiments we performed showed that the Cactis algorithm is better than the ORION algorithm and that the CK algorithm totally outperforms both other algorithms in terms of response time and clustering overhead.",DataMining,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0705.0454v1.pdf
